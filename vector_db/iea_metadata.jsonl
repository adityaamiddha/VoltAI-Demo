CC BY 4.0. Abstract The Global EV Outlook is an annual publication that identifies and discusses recent developments in electric mobility across the globe. It is developed with the support of the members of the Electric Vehicles Initiative (EVI). Combining historical analysis with projections to 2030, the report examines key areas of interest such as electric vehicle and charging infrastructure deployment, battery demand, electricity consumption, oil displacement, greenhouse gas emissions and related policy developments. The report includes analysis of lessons learned from leading markets to inform policy makers and stakeholders about policy frameworks and market systems for electric vehicle adoption. This edition features analysis of the financial performance of EV-related companies, venture capital investments in EV-related technologies, and trade of electric vehicles. Finally, the report makes available two online tools: the Global EV Data Explorer and Global EV Policy Explorer, which allow users to interactively explore EV statistics and projections, and policy measures worldwide.

CC BY 4.0. Executive summary Electric car sales break new records with momentum expected to continue through 2023 Electric car markets are seeing exponential growth as sales exceeded 10 million in 2022. A total of 14% of all new cars sold were electric in 2022, up from around 9% in 2021 and less than 5% in 2020. Three markets dominated global sales. China was the frontrunner once again, accounting for around 60% of global electric car sales. More than half of the electric cars on roads worldwide are now in China and the country has already exceeded its 2025 target for new energy vehicle sales. In Europe, the second largest market, electric car sales increased by over 15% in 2022, meaning that more than one in every five cars sold was electric. Electric car sales in the United States – the third largest market – increased 55% in 2022, reaching a sales share of 8%. Electric car sales are expected to continue strongly through 2023. Over 2.3 million electric cars were sold in the first quarter, about 25% more than in the same period last year. We currently expect to see 14 million in sales by the end of 2023, representing a 35% year-on-year increase with new purchases accelerating in the second half of this year. As a result, electric cars could account for 18% of total car sales across the full calendar year. National policies and incentives will help bolster sales, while a return to the exceptionally high oil prices seen last year could further motivate prospective buyers. There are promising signs for emerging electric vehicle (EV) markets, albeit from a small base. Electric car sales are generally low outside the major markets, but 2022 was a growth year in India, Thailand and Indonesia. Collectively, sales of electric cars in these countries more than tripled compared to 2021, reaching 80 000. For Thailand, the share of electric cars in total sales came in at slightly over 3% in 2022, while both India and Indonesia averaged around 1.5% last year. In India, EV and component manufacturing is ramping up, supported by the government’s USD 3.2 billion incentive programme that has attracted investments totalling USD 8.3 billion. Thailand and Indonesia are also strengthening their policy support schemes, potentially providing valuable experience for other emerging market economies seeking to foster EV adoption. Global EV Outlook 2023 Executive summary Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 9 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Landmark EV policies are driving the outlook for EVs closer to climate ambitions Market trends and policy efforts in major car markets are supporting a bright outlook for EV sales. Under the IEA Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), the global outlook for the share of electric car sales based on existing policies and firm objectives has increased to 35% in 2030, up from less than 25% in the previous outlook. In the projections, China retains its position as the largest market for electric cars with 40% of total sales by 2030 in the STEPS. The United States doubles its market share to 20% by the end of the decade as recent policy announcements drive demand, while Europe maintains its current 25% share. Projected demand for electric cars in major car markets will have profound implications on energy markets and climate goals in the current policy environment. Based on existing policies, oil demand from road transport is projected to peak around 2025 in the STEPS, with the amount of oil displaced by electric vehicles exceeding 5 million barrels per day in 2030. In the STEPS, emissions of around 700 Mt CO2-equivalents are avoided by the use of electric cars in 2030. The European Union and the United States have passed legislation to match their electrification ambitions. The European Union adopted new CO2 standards for cars and vans that are aligned with the 2030 goals set out in the Fit for 55 package. In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), combined with adoption of California’s Advanced Clean Cars II rule by a number of states, could deliver a 50% market share for electric cars in 2030, in line with the national target. The implementation of the recently proposed emissions standards from the US Environmental Protection Agency is set to further increase this share. Battery manufacturing continues to expand, encouraged by the outlook for EVs. As of March 2023, announcements on battery manufacturing capacity delivered by 2030 are more than sufficient to"}

As of March 2023, announcements on battery manufacturing capacity delivered by 2030 are more than sufficient to meet the demand implied by government pledges and would even be able to cover the demand for electric vehicles in the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario. It is therefore well possible that higher shares of sales are achievable for electric cars than those anticipated on the basis of current government policy and national targets. As spending and competition increase, a growing number of more affordable models come to market Global spending on electric cars exceeded USD 425 billion in 2022, up 50% relative to 2021. Only 10% of the spending can be attributed to government support, the remainder was from consumers. Investors have also maintained confidence in EVs, with the stocks of EV-related companies consistently Global EV Outlook 2023 Executive summary Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 10 IEA. CC BY 4.0. outperforming traditional carmakers since 2019. Venture capital investments in start-up firms developing EV and battery technologies have also boomed, reaching nearly USD 2.1 billion in 2022, up 30% relative to 2021, with investments increasing in batteries and critical minerals. SUVs and large cars dominate available electric car options in 2022. They account for 60% of available BEV options in China and Europe and an even greater share in the United States, similar to the trend towards SUVs seen in internal combustion engine (ICE) car markets. In 2022, ICE SUVs emitted over 1 Gt CO2, far greater than the 80 Mt net emissions reductions from the electric vehicle fleet that year. Battery electric SUVs often have batteries that are two- to three-times larger than small cars, requiring more critical minerals. However, last year electric SUVs resulted in the displacement of over 150 000 barrels of oil consumption per day and avoided the associated tailpipe emissions that would have been generated through burning the fuel in combustion engines. The electric car market is increasingly competitive. A growing number of new entrants, primarily from China but also from other emerging markets, are offering more affordable models. Major incumbent carmakers are increasing ambition as well, especially in Europe, and 2022-2023 saw another series of important EV announcements: fully electric fleets, cheaper cars, greater investment, and vertical integration with battery-making and critical minerals. Consumers can choose from an increasing number of options for electric cars. The number of available electric car models reached 500 in 2022, more than double the options available in 2018. However, outside of China, there is a need for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to offer affordable, competitively priced options in order to enable mass adoption of EVs. Today’s level of available electric car models is still significantly lower than the number of ICE options on the market, but the number of ICE models available has been steadily decreasing since its peak in the mid-2010s. Focus expands to electrification of more vehicle segments as electric cars surge ahead Electrification of road transport goes beyond cars. Two or three-wheelers are the most electrified market segment today; in emerging markets and developing economies, they outnumber cars. Over half of India’s three-wheeler registrations in 2022 were electric, demonstrating their growing popularity due to government incentives and lower lifecycle costs compared with conventional models, especially in the context of higher fuel prices. In many developing economies, two/three-wheelers offer an affordable way to get access to mobility, meaning their electrification is important to support sustainable development.

Electric light commercial vehicle (LCV) sales worldwide increased by more than 90% in 2022 to more than 310 000 vehicles, even as overall LCV sales declined by nearly 15%. In 2022, nearly 66 000 electric buses and 60 000 medium- and heavy-duty trucks were sold worldwide, representing about 4.5% of all bus sales and 1.2% of truck sales. Where governments have committed to reduce emissions from public transport, such as in dense urban areas, electric bus sales reached even higher shares; in Finland, for example, electric bus sales accounted for over 65% in 2022.

Ambition with respect to electrifying heavy-duty vehicles is growing. In 2022, around 220 electric heavy-duty vehicle models entered the market, bringing the total to over 800 models offered by well over 100 OEMs. A total of 27 governments have pledged to achieve 100% ZEV bus and truck sales by 2040 and both the United States and European Union have also proposed stronger emissions standards for heavy-duty vehicles. EV supply chains and batteries gain greater prominence in policy-making The increase in demand for electric vehicles is driving demand for batteries and related critical minerals. Automotive lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery demand increased by about 65% to 550 GWh in 2022, from about 330 GWh in 2021, primarily as a result of growth in electric passenger car sales. In 2022, about 60% of lithium, 30% of cobalt and 10% of nickel demand was for EV batteries. Only five years prior, these shares were around 15%, 10% and 2%, respectively. Reducing the need for critical materials will be important for supply chain sustainability, resilience and security, especially given recent price developments for battery material. New alternatives to conventional lithium-ion are on the rise. The share of lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) chemistries reached its highest point ever, driven primarily by China: around 95% of the LFP batteries for electric LDVs went into vehicles produced in China. Supply chains for (lithium-free) sodium-ion batteries are also being established, with over 100 GWh of manufacturing capacity either currently operating or announced, almost all in China. The EV supply chain is expanding, but manufacturing remains highly concentrated in certain regions, with China being the main player in battery and EV component trade. In 2022, 35% of exported electric cars came from China, compared with 25% in 2021. Europe is China’s largest trade partner for both electric cars and their batteries. In 2022, the share of electric cars manufactured in China and sold in the European market increased to 16%, up from about 11% in 2021. Global EV Outlook 2023 Executive summary Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 12 IEA. CC BY 4.0. EV supply chains are increasingly at the forefront of EV-related policymaking to build resilience through diversification. The Net Zero Industry Act, proposed by the European Union in March 2023, aims for nearly 90% of the European Union’s annual battery demand to be met by EU battery manufacturers, with a manufacturing capacity of at least 550 GWh in 2030. Similarly, India aims to boost domestic manufacturing of electric vehicles and batteries through Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes. In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act emphasises the strengthening of domestic supply chains for EVs, EV batteries and battery minerals, laid out in the criteria to qualify for clean vehicle tax credits. As a result, between August 2022 and March 2023, major EV and battery makers announced cumulative post-IRA investments of at least USD 52 billion in North American EV supply chains – of which 50% is for battery manufacturing, and about 20% each for battery components and EV manufacturing. Global EV Outlook 2023 Electric Vehicles Initiative Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 13 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Electric Vehicles Initiative The Electric Vehicles Initiative (EVI) is a multi-governmental policy forum established in 2010 under the Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM). Recognising the opportunities offered by EVs, the EVI is dedicated to accelerating the adoption of EVs worldwide. To do so, it strives to better understand the policy challenges related to electric mobility, to help governments address them and to serve as a platform for knowledge-sharing among government policy makers. The EVI also facilitates exchanges between government policy makers and a variety of other partners on topics important for the transition to electric mobility, such as charging infrastructure and grid integration as well as EV battery supply chains. In 2022, Zero Emission Government Fleet Declaration was launched within the EVI, a strong commitment among government to move towards 100% zero emission vehicles in public procurement. The International Energy Agency serves as the co-ordinator of the initiative. Governments that have been active in the EVI in the 2022-23 period include Canada, Chile, People’s Republic of China (hereafter “China”), Finland, France, Germany, India, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, United Kingdom and United States.

Global EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 14 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Trends and developments in EV markets Electric light-duty vehicles Electric car sales continue to increase, led by China Electric car sales 1 saw another record year in 2022, despite supply chain disruptions, macro-economic and geopolitical uncertainty, and high commodity and energy prices. The growth in electric car sales took place in the context of globally contracting car markets: total car sales in 2022 dipped by 3% relative to 2021. Electric car sales – including battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) – exceeded 10 million last year, up 55% relative to 2021.2 This figure – 10 million EV sales worldwide – exceeds the total number of cars sold across the entire European Union (about 9.5 million vehicles) and is nearly half of the total number of cars sold in China in 2022. In the course of just five years, from 2017 to 2022, EV sales jumped from around 1 million to more than 10 million. It previously took five years from 2012 to 2017 for EV sales to grow from 100 000 to 1 million, underscoring the exponential nature of EV sales growth. The share of electric cars in total car sales jumped from 9% in 2021 to 14% in 2022, more than 10 times their share in 2017. Over 26 million electric cars were on the road in 2022, up 60% relative to 2021 and more than 5 times the stock in Increasing sales pushed the total number of electric cars on the world’s roads to 26 million, up 60% relative to 2021, with BEVs accounting for over 70% of total annual growth, as in previous years. As a result, about 70% of the global stock of electric cars in 2022 were BEVs. The increase in sales from 2021 to 2022 was just as high as from 2020 to 2021 in absolute terms – up 3.5 million – but relative growth was lower (sales doubled from 2020 to 2021). The exceptional boom in 2021 may be explained by EV markets catching up in the wake of the coronavirus 1 The term sales, as used in this report, represents an estimate of the number of new vehicles hitting the roads. Where possible, data on new vehicle registrations is used. In some cases, however, only data on retail sales (such as sales from a dealership) are available. See Box 1.2 for further details. The term car is used to represent passenger light-duty vehicles and includes cars of different sizes, sports utility-vehicles and light trucks. 2 Unless otherwise specified, the term electric vehicle is used to refer to both battery electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles but does not include fuel cell electric vehicles.

Over 26 million electric cars were on the road in 2022, up 60% relative to 2021 and more than five times the stock in 2018. Half of the world’s electric cars are in China The increase in electric car sales varied across regions and powertrains, but remains dominated by the People’s Republic of China (hereafter “China”). In 2022, BEV sales in China increased by 60% relative to 2021 to reach 4.4 million, and PHEV sales nearly tripled to 1.5 million. The faster growth in PHEV sales relative to BEVs warrants further examination in the coming years, as PHEV sales still remain lower overall and could be catching up on the post-Covid-19 boom only now; BEV sales in China tripled from 2020 to 2021 after moderate growth over 2018-2020. Electric car sales increased even while total car sales dipped by 3% in 2022 relative to 2021. 5 15 25 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022 Million China BEV China PHEV Europe BEV Europe PHEV United States BEV United States PHEV Other BEV Other PHEV Global EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 16 IEA. CC BY 4.0. China accounted for nearly 60% of all new electric car registrations globally. For the first time in 2022, China accounted for more than 50% of all the electric cars on the world’s roads, a total of 13.8 million. This strong growth results from more than a decade of sustained policy support for early adopters, including an extension of purchase incentives initially planned for phase-out in 2020 to the end of 2022 due to Covid-19, in addition to non-financial support such as rapid roll-out of charging infrastructure and stringent registration policies for non-electric cars. In 2022, the share of electric cars in total domestic car sales reached 29% in China, up from 16% in 2021 and under 6% between 2018 and 2020. China has therefore achieved its 2025 national target of a 20% sales share for so-called new energy vehicles (NEVs)3 well in advance. All indicators point to further growth: although the national NEV sales target is yet to be updated by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), which is responsible for the automotive industry, the objective of greater road transport electrification is reaffirmed in multiple strategy documents. China aims to reach a 50% sales share by 2030 in so-called “key air pollution control regions”, and 40% across the country by 2030 to support the national action plan for carbon peaking. If recent market trends continue, China’s 2030 targets may also be reached ahead of time. Provincial governments are also supporting adoption of NEVs, with 18 provinces to date having set NEV targets. Support at the regional level in China has also helped to advance some of the world’s largest EV makers. Shenzhen-based BYD has supplied most of the city’s electric buses and taxis, and its leading position is also reflected in Shenzhen’s ambition of reaching a 60% NEV sales share by 2025. Guangzhou, which has a 50% NEV sales share by 2025 target, facilitated the expansion of Xpeng Motors to become one of the national EV frontrunners. 3 NEVs (China) include BEVs, PHEVs and fuel cell electric vehicles.

Electric car sales in China have been steadily increasing since 2020, but future trends will warrant further examination given that purchase incentives ended in 2022. Whether China’s electric car sales share will remain significantly above the 20% target in 2023 remains uncertain, as sales may have been especially high in anticipation of incentives being phased out at the end of 2022. Sales in January 2023 plunged, and while this is in part due to the timing of the Chinese New Year, they were nearly 10% lower than sales in January 2022. However, electric car sales caught up in February and March 2023, standing nearly 60% above sales in February 2022 and more than 25% above sales in March 2022, thereby bringing sales in the first quarter of 2023 more than 20% higher than in the first quarter of 2022. Growth remained steady in Europe despite disruptions In Europe,4 electric car sales increased by more than 15% in 2022 relative to 2021 to reach 2.7 million. Sales grew more quickly in previous years: annual growth stood at more than 65% in 2021 and averaged 40% over 2017-2019. In 2022, BEV sales rose by 30% relative to 2021 (compared to 65% growth in 2021 relative to 2020) while PHEV sales dipped by around 3%.

CC BY 4.0. sales are still increasing in Europe in the context of continued contraction in car markets: total car sales in Europe dipped by 3% in 2022 relative to 2021. The slowdown seen in Europe relative to previous years was, in part, a reflection of the exceptional growth in electric car sales that took place in 2020 and 2021 in the European Union, as manufacturers quickly adjusted corporate strategy to comply with the CO2 emission standards passed in 2019. These standards covered the 2020-2024 period, with EU-wide emission targets becoming stricter only from 2025 and 2030 onwards. High energy prices in 2022 had a mixed impact on the competitiveness of EVs relative to internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. Gasoline and diesel prices for ICE cars spiked, but residential electricity tariffs (with relevance for charging) also increased in some cases. Higher electricity and gas prices also increased manufacturing costs for both ICE and EV cars, with some carmakers arguing that high energy prices could restrict future investment for new battery manufacturing capacity. Europe remained the world’s second largest market for electric cars after China in 2022, accounting for 25% of all electric car sales and 30% of the global stock. The sales share of electric cars reached 21%, up from 18% in 2021, 10% in 2020 and under 3% prior to 2019. European countries continued to rank highly for the sales share of electric cars, led by Norway at 88%, Sweden at 54%, the Netherlands at 35%, Germany at 31%, the United Kingdom at 23% and France at 21% in 2022. In volume terms, Germany is the biggest market in Europe with sales of 830 000 in 2022, followed by the United Kingdom with 370 000 and France with 330 000. Sales also exceeded 80 000 in Spain. The share of electric cars in total car sales has increased tenfold in Germany since before the Covid-19 pandemic, which can in part be explained by increasing support post-pandemic, such as purchase incentives through the Umweltbonus, and a frontloading of sales in 2022 in expectation of subsidies being further reduced from 2023 onwards. However, in Italy, electric car sales decreased from 140 000 in 2021 to 115 000 in 2022, and they also decreased or stagnated in Austria, Denmark and Finland.

In the first two months of 2023, battery electric car sales were already up by over 30% year-on-year, while overall car sales increased by just over 10% year-on-year. The United States confirms return to growth In the United States, electric car sales increased 55% in 2022 relative to 2021, led by BEVs. Sales of BEVs increased by 70%, reaching nearly 800 000 and confirming a second consecutive year of strong growth after the 2019-2020 dip. Sales of PHEVs also grew, albeit by only 15%. The increase in electric car sales was particularly high in the United States, considering that total car sales dropped by 8% in 2022 relative to 2021, a much sharper decrease than the global average (minus 3%). Overall, the United States accounted for 10% of the global growth in sales. The total stock of electric cars reached 3 million, up 40% relative to 2021 and accounting for 10% of the global total. The share of electric cars in total car sales reached nearly 8%, up from just above 5% in 2021 and around 2% between 2018 and 2020. A number of factors are helping to increase sales in the United States. A greater number of available models, beyond those offered by Tesla, the historic leader, helped to close the supply gap. Given that major companies like Tesla and General Motors had already reached their subsidy cap under US support in previous years,5 new models from other companies being available means that more consumers can benefit from purchase incentives, which can be as high as USD 7 500. Awareness is increasing as government and companies lean towards electrification: in 2022, a quarter of Americans expect that their next car will be electric, according to the American Automobile Association. Although charging infrastructure and driving range have improved over the years, they remain major concerns for US drivers given the typically long travel distances and lower popularity and limited availability of alternatives such as rail. However, in 2021 the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law strengthened support for EV charging, allocating USD 5 billion in total funding over the 2022-2026 period through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program, as well as USD 2.5 billion in competitive grants over the same period through the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Discretionary Grant Program. 5 Manufacturer caps were still in place for sales taking place in 2022, with models by carmakers having sold over 200 000 EVs losing eligibility for the purchase incentive, even if they were manufactured in North America"}

Monthly sales of electric cars have been steadily increasing in the United States, with further growth expected in 2023 as a result of strengthened policy support. The acceleration in sales growth could continue in 2023 and beyond thanks to recent new policy support (see Prospects for electric vehicle deployment). The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has triggered a rush by global electromobility companies to expand US manufacturing operations. Between August 2022 and March 2023, major EV and battery makers announced cumulative post-IRA investments of USD 52 billion in North American EV supply chains, of which 50% is for battery manufacturing, and about 20% each for battery components and EV manufacturing. Overall, company announcements including tentative commitments for US investments for future battery and EV production add up to around USD 75-108 billion. As an example, Tesla plans to relocate its Berlinbased lithium-ion battery gigafactory to Texas, where it will work in partnership with China’s CATL, and to manufacture next-generation EVs in Mexico. Ford also announced a deal with CATL for a battery plant in Michigan, and plans to increase electric car manufacturing sixfold by the end of 2023 relative to 2022, at 600 000 vehicles per year, scaling up to 2 million by 2026. BMW is seeking to expand EV manufacturing at its plant in South Carolina following the IRA. Volkswagen chose Canada for its first battery plant outside Europe, which will begin operations in 2027, and is also investing USD 2 billion in its plant in South Carolina. While these investments can be expected to lead to high growth in the years to come, the impact may only fully be seen from 2024 onwards as plants come online. ​ 97% 68% 42% 62% 38% 19% 47% 50% 34%69%65% 45% 112% 76% 22% 25 75 125 Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar 2021 2023 Thousand BEV PHEV IRA Global EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 22 IEA. CC BY 4.0. In the immediate term, the IRA has constrained eligibility requirements for purchase incentives, as vehicles need to be produced in North America in order to qualify for a subsidy. However, electric car sales have remained strong since August 2022 (Figure 1.4), and the first months of 2023 have been no exception: In the first quarter of 2023, electric car sales increased 60% compared to the same period in 2022, potentially boosted by the January 2023 removal of the subsidy caps for manufacturers, which means models by market leaders can now benefit from purchase incentives. In the longer-term, the list of models eligible for subsidies is expected to expand. Box 1.1 The 2023 outlook for electric cars is bright Early indications from first quarter sales of 2023 point to an upbeat market, supported by cost declines as well as strengthened policy support in key markets such as the United States. Globally, our current estimate is therefore for nearly 14 million electric cars to be sold in 2023, building on the more than 2.3 million already sold in the first quarter of the year. This represents a 35% increase in electric car sales in 2023 compared to 2022 and would bring the global electric sales share to around 18%, up from 14% in 2022. Electric car sales, 2010-2023 IEA.

Electric car sales in the first three months of 2023 have shown strong signs of growth compared to the same period in 2022. In the United States, more than 320 000 electric cars were sold in the first quarter of 2023, 60% more than over the same period in 2022. Our current expectation is for this growth to be sustained throughout the year, with electric car sales reaching over 1.5 million in 2023, bringing the electric car sales share in the United States up to around 12% in 2023. 2 6 10 14 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023E Million China Europe United States Other Global EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 23 IEA. CC BY 4.0. In China, electric car sales were off to a rough start in 2023, with January sales being 8% lower than in January 2022. The latest available data suggests a quick recovery: over the entire first quarter of 2023, electric car sales in China were more than 20% higher than in the first quarter of 2022, with more than 1.3 million electric cars being registered. For the remainder of 2023, we expect the generally favourable cost structure of electric cars to outweigh the effects of the phase-out of the NEV subsidy. As a result, our current expectation is for electric car sales in China to be more than 30% higher than in 2022 and reach around 8 million by the end of 2023, reaching a sales share of over 35% (from 29% in 2022). Based on recent trends and tightening CO2 targets not going into effect until 2025, the growth of electric car sales in Europe is expected to be the lowest of the three largest markets. In the first quarter of 2023, electric car sales in Europe increased by around 10% compared to the same period in 2022. For the full year, we currently expect electric car sales to increase by over 25%, with one-in-four cars sold in Europe being electric. Outside of the major EV markets, electric car sales are expected to reach around 900 000 in 2023 – 50% higher than in 2022. Electric car sales in India in the first quarter of 2023 are already double what they were in the same period in 2022. In India and across all regions outside the three major EV markets, electric car sales are expected to represent 2-3% of car sales in 2023, a relatively small yet growing share. There are, of course, downside risks to the 2023 outlook: a sluggish global economy and the phase-out of subsidies for NEVs in China could reduce 2023 growth in global electric car sales. On the upside, new markets may open up more quickly than anticipated, as persistent high oil prices make the case for EVs stronger in an increasing number of settings. And new policy developments, such as the April 2023 proposal from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to strengthen GHG emissions standards for cars, may send signals that boost sales even before going into effect. The number of electric car models rises, especially for large cars and SUVs, at the same time as it decreases for conventional cars The race to electrification is increasing the number of electric car models available on the market. In 2022, the number of available options reached 500, up from below 450 in 2021 and more than doubling relative to 2018-2019. As in previous years, China has the broadest portfolio with nearly 300 available models, double the number available in 2018-2019, prior to the Covid-19 pandemic.

However, the number of electric car models available remains much lower than that of conventional ICE cars, which has remained above 1 250 since 2010 and peaked at 1 500 in the middle of the past decade. In recent years, the number of ICE models sold has been steadily decreasing, at a compound annual growth rate of minus 2% over the 2016-2022 period, reaching about 1 300 models in 2022. This dip varies across major car markets and is most pronounced in China, where the number of available ICE options was 8% lower in 2022 than in 2016, versus 3-4% lower in the United States and Europe over the same period. This could result from contracting car markets and a progressive shift towards EVs among major carmakers. Looking forward, the total number of ICE models available could remain stable, while the number of new models shrinks, if carmakers focus on electrification and keep selling existing ICE options rather than increasing budgets to develop new models. 250 750 1 000 1 250 1 500 1 750 2013 2019 Available models Global availability over time BEV PHEV ICE 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% World China Europe USA World BEV types in 2022 Small car Medium car Crossover Large car SUV ICE Global EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 25 IEA. CC BY 4.0. In contrast to ICE models, EV model availability has been growing quickly, at a compound annual growth rate of 30% over the 2016-2022 period. Such growth is to be expected in a nascent market with a large number of new entrants bringing innovative products to the market, and as incumbents diversify their portfolios. Growth has been slightly lower in recent years: the annual growth rate stood at around 25% in 2021 and 15% in 2022. In the future, the number of models can be expected to continue to increase quickly, as major carmakers expand their EV portfolios and new entrants strengthen their positions, particularly in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs). The historic number of ICE models available on the market suggests that the current number of EV options could double, at least, before stabilising.

The number of large models is increasing more quickly than that of small models. SUVs and large car models dominate both EV and ICE markets A major concern for global car markets – both EV and ICE – is the overwhelming dominance of SUVs and large models among available options. Carmakers are able to generate higher revenues from such models, given higher profit margins, which can cover some of the investments made in developing electric options. In certain cases, such as in the United States, larger vehicles can also benefit from less stringent fuel economy standards, hence creating an incentive for carmakers to slightly increase the vehicle size of a car for it to qualify as a light truck. However, large models are more expensive, which poses significant affordability issues across the board, and all the more so in EMDEs.

In 2022, the sales-weighted average battery size of small battery electric cars ranged from 25 kWh in China to 35 kWh across France, Germany and the United Kingdom, and about 60 kWh in the United States. In comparison, the average for battery electric SUVs was around 70-75 kWh in these countries, and within the 75-90 kWh range for large car models. Transitioning from ICE to electric is a priority for achieving net zero emissions targets, regardless of vehicle size, but mitigating the impacts of higher battery sizes will also be important. In France, Germany and the United Kingdom in 2022, the sales-weighted average weight of a battery electric SUV was 1.5 times higher than the average small battery electric car, requiring greater amounts of steel, aluminium and plastic; the battery in the SUV was twice as large, requiring about 75% more critical minerals. The CO2 emissions associated with materials processing, manufacturing and assembly can be estimated at more than 70% higher as a result. At the same time, in 2022, electric SUVs resulted in the displacement of over 150 000 barrels per day of oil consumption and avoided the associated tailpipe emissions that would have been generated through burning the fuel in combustion engines. Although electric SUVs represented roughly 35% of all electric passenger light-duty vehicles (PLDVs) in 2022, their share of oil displacement was even higher (about 40%), as SUVs tend to be driven more than smaller cars. Of course, smaller vehicles generally require less energy to operate and less materials to build, but electric SUVs certainly remain favourable to ICE vehicles. In 2022, ICE SUVs emitted more than 1 Gt CO2, far greater than the 80 Mt net emissions reductions from the electric vehicle fleet that year. While total car sales decreased by 0.5% in 2022, SUV sales increased by 3% relative to 2021, accounting for about 45% of total car sales, with noticeable growth in the United States, India and Europe. Of the 1 300 available options for ICE cars in 2022, more than 40% were SUVs, compared to fewer than 35% for small and medium cars. The total number of available ICE options went down from 2016 to 2022, but the drop was only for small and medium cars (down 35%) while large cars and SUVs increased (up 10%). Similar trends are observed in EV markets. Around 16% of all SUVs sold were electric in 2022, which is above the overall market share of EVs and demonstrates consumer preferences for SUVs regardless of whether they are an ICE vehicle or EV. Nearly 40% of all BEV models available in 2022 were SUVs, which is equivalent to the shares of small and medium car options combined. Other large models accounted for more than 15%. Just 3 years before, in 2019, small and medium models accounted for 60% of all available models, and SUVs just 30%.

CC BY 4.0. suggesting that electric cars currently remain somewhat smaller than their ICE equivalents. Announcements by some major European carmakers indicate that there could be a greater focus on smaller, more popular models in the years to come. For example, Volkswagen has announced the launch of a compact model for the European market under EUR 25 000 by 2025 and under EUR 20 000 by 2026-2027, as a means to appeal to a broader consumer base. In the United States, over 80% of available BEV options in 2022 were SUVs or large car models, which is greater than the share of ICE SUVs or large models at 70%. Looking ahead, more electric SUVs are to be expected in the United States, should recent policy announcements on expansion of IRA incentives to more SUVs be implemented. Following the IRA, the US Treasury has been revising vehicle classifications, and in 2023 changed the eligibility criteria for clean vehicle credits relevant to smaller SUVs, which are now eligible if priced under USD 80 000, up from the previous limit of USD 55 000. Electric cars remain much cheaper in China The growth in electric car sales in China has been underpinned by sustained policy support, but also cheaper retail prices. In 2022, the sales-weighted average price of a small BEV in China was below USD 10 000. This is significantly less than the prices of small BEVs found in Europe and the United States, where the salesweighted average price exceeded USD 30 000 in the same year.

Together, these two models accounted for nearly 15% of Chinese BEV passenger car sales, illustrating the appetite for smaller models. To compare, the best-selling small BEVs across France, Germany and the United Kingdom – Fiat’s 500, Peugeot’s e-208 and Renault’s Zoe – were all priced above USD 35 000. Few small BEVs were sold in the United States, limited mainly to Chevrolet’s Bolt and the Mini Cooper BEV, which are priced around USD 30 000. Tesla’s Y Model was the best-selling BEV passenger car in both the selected European countries (priced at more than USD 65 000) and the United States (more than USD 50 000).6 Chinese carmakers have focused on developing smaller and more affordable models in advance of their international peers, cutting down costs following years of tough competition domestically. Hundreds of small EV manufacturers have entered the market since the 2000s, benefitting from a variety of public support schemes, including subsidies and incentives for both consumers and manufacturers. The majority of these firms went bankrupt due to competition as subsidies were gradually phased out, and the market has since consolidated around a dozen frontrunners, which have succeeded in developing small and cheap electric cars for the Chinese market.

Vertical integration of battery and EV supply chains from mineral processing to battery and EV manufacturing, as well as cheaper labour, manufacturing and access to finance across the board, have also contributed to developing cheaper models. Meanwhile, carmakers in Europe and the United States – both early developers such as Tesla and incumbent major manufacturers – have mostly focused on larger or more luxurious models to date, hence offering few options affordable for mass-market consumers. However, the small options available in these countries typically offer greater performance than those in China, such as longer driving range. In 2022, the sales-weighted average range of small BEVs sold in the United States was nearly 350 km, while in France, Germany and the United Kingdom it was just under 300 km, compared to under 220 km in China. For other segments, the differences are less significant. The broader availability of public charging points in China may, in part, explain why consumers there have been more willing to opt for lower driving ranges than their European or American counterparts. In 2022, Tesla heavily reduced the price of its models on two occasions as competition increased, and many carmakers have also announced cheaper options in the coming years. While these announcements warrant further examination, this trend could indicate that the price gap between small electric cars and incumbent ICE options could progressively close during this decade. 6 However, Tesla has decreased car prices several times since the publication of the IRA in the United States, in part to boost sales as competition gets tougher (see section on corporate strategy and finance).

Emerging markets see encouraging growth China, Europe and the United States – the three major markets for electric cars – accounted for about 95% of global sales in 2022. Emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) outside China account for only a fraction of the global electric car market. Demand for electric cars has increased in recent years, but sales remain low. While EMDEs often quickly adopt low-cost emerging technology products (e.g. smartphones, computers and connected devices), electric cars remain typically too expensive for the majority of the population. According to a recent survey, over 50% of Ghanaian respondents would prefer to purchase an EV to an ICE vehicle, but more than half of those potential consumers would not be willing to spend more than USD 20 000 for an electric car. Lack of access to reliable and affordable charging can be a barrier, as can limited access to EV servicing, maintenance and repair. In most EMDEs, road transport remains largely based on smaller mobility solutions in urban centres, such as two- and three-wheelers, which have seen much greater success in terms of electrification, as well as shared mobility for regional commutes. Purchasing behaviour is also different, with lower personal car ownership rates and more common purchase of used cars. Looking forward, while sales of electric cars – both new and used – can be expected to increase in EMDEs, it is likely that many countries will continue to rely primarily on two- and three-wheelers (see subsequent section on these vehicles in this report). There was a notable boom in electromobility in 2022 in India, Thailand and Indonesia. Collectively, sales of electric cars in these countries more than tripled relative to 2021, reaching nearly 80 000. Sales in 2022 were 7 times higher than in 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic. In contrast, sales in other EMDEs were lower. In India, BEV sales reached nearly 50 000 in 2022, 4 times more than in 2021, while total car sales increased by just below 15%. Leading domestic manufacturer Tata accounted for over 85% of BEV sales, including through sales of its small BEV Tigor/Tiago, which quadrupled. Indian PHEV sales remained close to zero. Burgeoning electromobility companies are now betting on the government’s Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme – with around USD 2 billion in subsidy programmes – to ramp up EV and component manufacturing. This scheme has attracted investments totalling USD 8.3 billion. The Indian market, however, currently remains geared towards shared and smaller mobility. In 2022, 25% of electric car purchases in India were by fleet operators, such as for taxis. In early 2023, Tata secured a large order from Uber for 25 000 electric cars.

Tesla is planning to enter the Thai market in 2023 along with building Superchargers. In Indonesia, BEV sales multiplied by more than 14, exceeding 10 000, while PHEV sales remained close to zero. In March 2023, Indonesia announced new incentives to support sales of electric two-wheelers, cars and buses, with the aim of strengthening domestic capacity in EV and battery manufacturing through local component requirements. The government aims to subsidise the sale of 200 000 electric two-wheelers and 36 000 electric cars in 2023, reaching a sales share of 4% and 5% respectively. The new subsidies could reduce the price of an electric two-wheeler by 25-50% to help compete against ICE equivalents. Indonesia plays an important role in EV and battery supply chains, in particular given its abundant raw mineral resources and status as the world’s largest nickel miner. This has attracted investment from global companies, and Indonesia could become the largest manufacturing hub in the region for batteries and components. Model availability remains an issue in EMDEs, with many of the options on sale heavily geared towards the higher end, such as SUVs, large and luxury models. While the trend for SUVs is global, purchasing power is more limited in EMDEs, making such vehicles largely unaffordable. Across the different regions considered in this section of the report, for a total of more than 60 EMDEs, including those which receive support from the Global Environment Facility’s (GEF) Global E-Mobility Programme, there were two to six times more large models available than small ones in 2022. In Africa, the best-selling electric car model in 2022 was the Hyundai Kona, a crossover BEV, and there were about as many recorded sales of Porsche’s large and expensive Taycan BEV as there were of Nissan’s medium-sized Leaf BEV. There were also eight times more sales of electric SUVs than of the Mini Cooper SE BEV and Renault Zoe BEV combined, the two best-selling small electric cars. In India, the best-selling electric car model was Tata’s crossover Nexon BEV, with over 32 000 sales, or three times more than the second best-selling model, Tata’s Global EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 32 IEA. CC BY 4.0. small Tigor/Tiago BEV. Across all of the EMDEs considered here, sales of electric SUVs reached 45 000, which is more than the sales of small (23 000) and medium (16 000) electric cars combined. In Costa Rica, the leading country in Latin America in terms of BEV sales share, only 4 models in the top 20 were not SUVs, and nearly a third were luxury models. The future of mass-market electrification in EMDEs relies on the development of smaller, more affordable electric cars, alongside two- and three-wheelers. Box 1.2 On the distinction between vehicle registrations and vehicle sales An important distinction for assessing the evolution of vehicle markets is the difference between registrations and sales. New registrations represent the number of vehicles that have been officially registered for the first time with the relevant government ministry or insurance agency, including domestically produced and imported vehicles. Sales can either refer to vehicles sold by dealers or agencies (retail sales), or to vehicles sold to dealers by vehicle manufacturers (factory shipments, i.e. including exports). The choice of metric can make a significant difference when analysing vehicle markets. For consistency in accounting across all countries, and to avoid double-counting at a global level, in this report vehicle market sizes are based on new vehicle registrations, where available, and retail sales otherwise, not on factory shipments. China’s vehicle market trends in 2022 are a good illustration of why this matters. In 2022, an increase of 7 to 10% in factory shipments (reported as sales) for the Chinese passenger car market was reported, while insurance registrations showed a stagnation of the domestic market in the same year. This increase was observed in data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM), which is the official data source for China’s car industry. CAAM data is collected from car manufacturers and represents factory shipments. Another widely referenced source is the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA), a non-governmental organisation that provides wholesale, retail sales and exports for passenger cars, but is not qualified to"}

The China Automotive Technology and Research Center (CATARC) is a state-owned think tank, and collects car production numbers from vehicle identification numbers and car sales numbers from vehicle insurance registrations. In China, vehicle insurance is registered for the vehicle itself and not for the individual driver, and is therefore useful for tracking the number of vehicles on the road, including imports. The main differences between CATARC data and the other sources stem from exports and military or other cars that do not get registered, and inventory stocks of vehicle manufacturers. In 2022 the total exports of passenger cars increased rapidly, making the differences between these data sources more apparent. In 2022 the export of Global EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 33 IEA. CC BY 4.0. passenger vehicles increased by almost 60%, exceeding 2.5 million, while the imports of passenger vehicles decreased by almost 20% (950 000 to 770 000). Similar discrepancies between factory shipments and insurance registrations are apparent in the Chinese bus and truck (commercial vehicle) market. In both 2021 and 2022, total volumes of factory shipments were substantially higher than insurance registrations, implying net export shares of commercial vehicles of about 9% in 2021 and more than 13% in 2022.

Sales of electric light commercial vehicles continue to increase, catching up with electric car sales Electric light commercial vehicle (LCV) sales worldwide nearly doubled in 2022 relative to 2021 to more than 310 000 vehicles, even as overall LCV sales declined by more than 10% (Figure 1.9).

Current trends indicate that the electric LCV market is catching up with that of electric cars, suggesting that the gap in terms of EV sales shares could narrow in the future. For the first time in 2022, the increase in the share of electric LCVs outpaced that of electric passenger cars (albeit from a low base). This demonstrates that once a critical tipping point in terms of favourability of total cost of ownership (TCO) has been achieved, commercial vehicle purchasers are likely to respond more rapidly to economic fundamentals than private consumers. Commercial vehicle owners typically use their vehicles more intensively, and as they have an imperative to maximise profit, EVs provide an opportunity to considerably reduce operating costs. The experience of commercial owners can also provide learnings for the private consumers segment: better fleet and charging management could help address concerns over range limitations. The share of PHEVs in LCVs has remained very low; around 98% of both electric LCV sales and stock in 2022 were BEVs. It is likely that this reflects the economic favourability of the battery electric powertrain – as opposed to plug-in hybrids – in commercial operations characterised by intensive usage, regularity and predictability (in terms of driving range, geographic extent, and return-to-base for overnight charging), as well as the lower maintenance and service costs of battery electric LCVs.

In 2022, China led in terms of overall electric LCV sales with over 130 000 units sold, and nearly 15% of LCVs sold being electric.7 Subsidies for battery electric and fuel cell trucks and vocational vehicles (including LCVs) have decreased in recent years, but overall zero-emission commercial truck sales have been growing since 2020, even as subsidies per vehicle have declined, indicating the increasing commercial competitiveness of electric trucks. In terms of market share, Korea continued to lead in 2022 with 27% of LCV sales being electric (36 000 vehicles), but sales growth in 2022 slowed to half its level in the previous year. This may be due to changes to the subsidy scheme for LCVs and to the repealing in April 2022 of a policy that made obtaining commercial registration permits easier for electric LCVs than ICE models (see Policy developments and corporate strategy). Light commercial EV sales shares also grew substantially in the Nordic countries, with Norway reaching 25%, Iceland 16%, and Sweden 13%. In all other key European and North American national markets, shares are lower than 10%, and typically less than the global average of 3.5%, but the rate of growth in market share for electric LCVs was higher than for passenger light-duty vehicles (PLDVs) (albeit from a lower baseline) across most leading EV markets, including the United States, Japan, and the European Union. Electric two-wheeler sales declined in China while global electric three-wheeler sales continued to rise Global electric two-wheeler sales totalled about 9.2 million in 2022, a drop of nearly 18% from 2021 (Figure 1.10). This drop is almost entirely attributable to the dip in sales of electric mopeds and motorcycles in China, which fell from 10.2 million in 2021 to under 7.7 million in 2022, even as the overall two-wheeler market there continued to grow. Supply chain challenges stemming from China’s pandemic-related restrictions in 2022 hit the electric two-wheeler market particularly hard, and in spite of growth in sales of premium domestic and imported two-wheelers (e.g. from BMW, Ducati and others), the overall sales share of electric two-wheelers dipped back below 50%.8 Despite the decline in sales, China 7 Commercial truck sales in China are reported according to four gross vehicle weight (GVW) bins: less than 1.8 tonnes, 1.86 tonnes, 6-14 tonnes, and greater than 14 tonnes. These are reallocated to categories based on other external data sources to match IEA’s harmonised global definitions of light commercial vehicles (less than 3.5 tonnes GVW), medium trucks (3.515 tonnes), and heavy trucks (15 tonnes GVW and above). 8 As with other vehicle types, tracking new two-wheeler registrations (“sales”) in China is difficult, as the official data source, CAAM, tracks factory shipments, and hence reports volumes that include exported vehicles. Tracking is particularly difficult in the case of electric two-wheelers, however, as many data sources include pedal-electric bicycles and other small electric mopeds (see, for instance, a recent industry report from Honda). Chinese data sources give vehicle sales of electric twowheelers at around 50 million in 2021, and 60 million in 2022, of which about 7.6 million are classified as motorcycles (China Chamber of Commerce for Motorcycles). Some of these attain top speeds of less than 50 km/hour, and so are excluded from the above figures.

CC BY 4.0. India leads on sales of electric three-wheelers thanks to policy support and innovative business models Sales of electric three-wheelers, which play an important role in urban mobility in India for both cargo and passenger services, soared to 425 000 units in 2022. Sales have been strong in India for a number of years, with hundreds of thousands of electric three-wheelers sold every year since 2012, with the exception of 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic reduced sales volumes to 30% of the previous year. Over half of India’s three-wheeler registrations in 2022 were electric, demonstrating their growing popularity due government incentives and lower lifecycle costs compared with conventional models, as well as higher fuel prices. IEA analysis on the TCO in India suggests that electric three-wheelers are already 70% cheaper than their gasoline-power ICE equivalents over their lifetime (IEA, forthcoming). Policies including the purchase incentives under FAME II, supply-side incentives under the PLI scheme, tax benefits and India’s Go Electric campaign all contributed to reducing the higher upfront costs (see Policy developments and corporate strategy for a detailed discussion of these and other policies). A total of 15 Indian states have already adopted EV policies to promote stronger EV deployment (and many more are drafting them), the majority of which include additional demand incentives. Bulk procurement schemes, the emergence of the battery-as-a-service (BaaS) business model and India’s draft battery swapping policy all give further impetus to the rapidly rising sales of electric three-wheelers. China followed India in terms of electric three-wheeler sales, with nearly 350 000 units sold in 2022. Together, China and India accounted for nearly 99% of global electric three-wheeler sales. Box 1.3 Korea continues to lead fuel cell electric car growth In 2022, the stock of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) increased 40% compared to 2021, reaching over 72 000 vehicles globally. About 80% of the FCEVs are cars, 10% trucks and almost 10% buses. In 2022, the fuel cell truck segment grew at a faster rate than cars and buses, increasing 60%. Korea is now home to over half of all fuel cell cars globally. Two-thirds of the additional 15 000 fuel cell cars that hit the road in 2022 were in Korea. This can be attributed in part to a policy landscape that supports FCEV production and sales, which has also led to Hyundai being the top fuel cell automaker.

China continues to account for about 80% of global electric bus sales and 85% of electric truck sales, as well as exporting large volumes of both. Within Europe, the sales share for electric buses was highest in Finland, where electric buses made up two-thirds of sales in 2022, Norway and the Netherlands, where they made up nearly half of sales, and Denmark, where they made up nearly one-third. Sales shares were also high in Sweden, Switzerland and Israel. Electric trucks sales shares remain low across most major markets.

The majority of electric trucks sold in China are box trucks,10 and 90% of electric truck sales were under 4.5 tonnes in gross vehicle weight (GVW), with the majority of these being between 3.5-4.5 tonnes. Electric truck sales for tractor-trailers and garbage trucks in China have also grown rapidly from a low base. Until the past few years, the production and sales volumes of electric buses and trucks ebbed and flowed based on subsidies. The central government introduced subsidies totalling nearly CNY 30 billion (Chinese Yuan renminbi) (USD 4.3 billion) in 2016 and 2017, the vast majority of which went to electric buses; BYD buses alone received about CNY 10 billion (USD 1.5 billion). Despite a progressive reduction in subsidies from 2018 onwards (total subsidies from 2018-2021 were less than CNY 20 billion [USD 2.9 billion]), electric bus and truck sales began increasing in 2021 and grew again in 2022, a promising sign that they have reached cost and performance metrics that make them increasingly competitive without government support. Cost reductions are also being driven by market consolidation and economies of scale. Indeed, China's commercial electric truck sales (including both LCVs and medium- and heavy-duty trucks – see section above on electric LCVs) dipped from a high of nearly 150 000 in 2017 (immediately following the adoption of the subsidy) to a low point in 2020, at 59 000; before rebounding to reach 186 000 total electric truck sales in 2022, despite declining subsidies on a per-vehicle basis in both 2021 and 2022. Zero-emission vehicle model availability expanded in 2022 in the medium- and heavy-duty truck segments The number of models on offer for zero-emission trucks has continued to expand in 2022, with nearly 840 current and announced medium- and heavy-duty vehicle models in the Global Drive to Zero Emission Technology Inventory (ZETI) database. The trend of new model development has shifted from buses to medium- and heavy-duty trucks. Of the 220 models that became available in 2022, more than half were either medium-duty trucks (over 60 models) or heavy-duty trucks (over 50 models), reflecting the fact that truck manufacturers are increasingly gaining confidence in supplying larger, heavier zero-emission models with greater payloads. The majority (over 90%) of the already available medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks models are battery electric; 12 models of fuel cell heavy-duty trucks are currently available – and another 8 are due to become available in 202324. Of commercially available bus and truck models in 2022, 60% (over 500 models) were produced by OEMs headquartered in China. Another 20% (over 170 models) were produced by North American OEMs, and 15% (over 120 models) by European OEMs. 10 Box trucks are light commercial and medium-duty chassis cab trucks with an enclosed box-shaped cargo space in the back.

China dominates heavy-duty battery production European and North American electric bus and truck makers rely heavily on Asian battery makers. Given their dominance in lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery chemistries, China’s CATL produces the vast majority of batteries for trucks. However, spurred on by industrial policies – the European Union’s Green Industrial Plan and the United States’ IRA – truck makers have already begun to build or are announcing investments in new production facilities for heavy-duty battery packs (such as Volvo’s 2.7 GWh plant, which opened in Sweden in 2022). Truck makers have also entered collaborations with major cell makers, seeking to secure further opportunities for vertical integration. More than 95% of heavy-duty trucks produced in China were equipped with LFP cathode chemistries in 2021. The durability and lower cost of LFP batteries make them the preferred choice not only because of the high lifetime mileage needed for commercial operations, but also because price is a concern for bus and truck buyers: over half of truck purchases are leases or rely on loans. The battery capacity of currently available commercial and announced models included in the ZETI database within a given vehicle type generally correlates with declared vehicle range (Figure 1.12). Table 1 shows how average battery capacity has generally increased across most bus categories from 2019 to 2022. However, no such clear trend is apparent across coaches or truck categories.

Actual vehicle range depends on the loaded vehicle weight, duty cycle, aerodynamics and drivetrain efficiency, as well as environmental factors such as temperature. In addition, as no harmonised test procedure currently exists to measure electric range for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles in any of the major markets where deployment of electric trucks has begun, manufacturers can determine their own methods to declare the electric range of the commercially available and announced models. However, any standardised test procedure would need to consider complicated issues of non-motive energy consumption (e.g. heating ventilation and air conditioning in buses, cooling in refrigerated trucks), as well as the potential for buses and trucks to be used in vehicle-to-grid applications (as has been demonstrated, for instance, with electric school buses in the United States). In light of such considerations, a first regulatory step could be to mandate that electric medium- and heavy-duty vehicle makers measure and disclose the usable battery energy according to a yet-to-be-developed standardised measurement procedure. Charging infrastructure Public charging points are increasingly necessary to enable wider EV uptake While most of the charging demand is currently met by home charging, publicly accessible chargers are increasingly needed in order to provide the same level of convenience and accessibility as for refuelling conventional vehicles. In dense urban areas, in particular, where access to home charging is more limited, public charging infrastructure is a key enabler for EV adoption. At the end of 2022, there were 2.7 million public charging points worldwide, more than 900 000 of which were installed in 2022, about a 55% increase on 2021 stock, and comparable to the pre-pandemic growth rate of 50% between 2015 and 2019. Slow chargers Globally, more than 600 000 public slow charging points11 were installed in 2022, 360 000 of which were in China, bringing the stock of slow chargers in the country to more than 1 million.

Fast chargers Publicly accessible fast chargers, especially those located along motorways, enable longer journeys and can address range anxiety, a barrier to EV adoption. Like slow chargers, public fast chargers also provide charging solutions to consumers who do not have reliable access to private charging, thereby encouraging EV adoption across wider swaths of the population. The number of fast chargers increased by 330 000 globally in 2022, though again the majority (almost 90%) of the growth came from China. The deployment of fast charging compensates for the lack of access to home chargers in densely populated cities and supports China’s goals for rapid EV deployment. China accounts for total of 760 000 fast chargers, but more than 70% of the total public fast charging pile stock is situated in just ten provinces.

The United States installed 6 300 fast chargers in 2022, about three-quarters of which were Tesla Superchargers. The total stock of fast chargers reached 28 000 at the end of 2022. Deployment is expected to accelerate in the coming years following government approval of the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program (NEVI). All US states, Washington DC, and Puerto Rico are participating in the programme, and have already been allocated USD 885 million in funding for 2023 to support the build-out of chargers across 122 000 km of highway (see Policy support for EV charging infrastructure). The US Federal Highway Administration has announced new national standards for federally funded EV chargers to ensure consistency, reliability, accessibility and compatibility. As a result of the new standards, Tesla has announced it will open a portion of its US Supercharger (where Superchargers represent 60% of the total stock of fast chargers in the United States) and Destination Charger network to non-Tesla EVs.

Source: IEA analysis based on country submissions. In many advanced markets, as the stock share of battery electric LDVs increased, the charging point per BEV ratio has decreased. While PHEVs are less reliant on public charging infrastructure than BEVs, policymaking relating to the sufficient availability of charging points should incorporate (and encourage) public PHEV charging. If the total number of electric LDVs per charging point is considered, the global average in 2022 was about ten EVs per charger. Countries such as China, Korea and the Netherlands have maintained fewer than ten EVs per charger throughout past years. In countries that rely heavily on public charging, the number of publicly accessible chargers has been expanding at a speed that largely matches EV deployment. However, in some markets characterised by widespread availability of home charging (due to a high share of single-family homes with the opportunity to install a charger) the number of EVs per public charging point can be even higher. For example, in the United States, the ratio of EVs per charger is 24, and in Norway is more than 30. As the market penetration of EVs increases, public charging becomes increasingly important, even in these countries, to support EV adoption among drivers who do not have access to private home or workplace charging options. However, the optimal ratio of EVs per charger will differ based on local conditions and driver needs. 2016 2018 2020 2022 2015 2017 2019 0.0 0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6 2.0 2.4 0% 1% 2% 3% 4% 5% 6% 7% 8% 9% 10% 11% 12% 13% 14% 15% 16% 17% 18% 19% BEV LDV stock share United States Norway China Netherlands Global EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 47 IEA.

Source: IEA analysis based on country submissions. Countries show different speeds in public charging deployment as the number of EVs on the road increases. Perhaps more important than the number of public chargers available is the total public charging power capacity per EV, given that fast chargers can serve more EVs than slow chargers. During the early stages of EV adoption, it makes sense for available charging power per EV to be high, assuming that charger utilisation will be relatively low until the market matures and the utilisation of infrastructure becomes more efficient. In line with this, the European Union’s provisional agreement on the AFIR includes requirements for the total power capacity to be provided based on the size of the registered fleet. Globally, the average public charging power capacity per electric LDV is around 2.4 kW per EV. In the European Union, the ratio is lower, with an average around 1.2 kW per EV.

The number of electric light-duty vehicles per public EV charging point varies dramatically between countries, ranging from about 2 vehicles per charging point in Korea to almost 100 in New Zealand. Charging needs for heavy-duty vehicles In the regions where electric trucks are becoming commercially available, battery electric trucks can compete on a TCO basis with conventional diesel trucks for a growing range of operations, not only urban and regional, but also in the heavyduty tractor-trailer regional and long-haul segments. Three parameters that determine the time at which TCO parity is reached are tolls; fuel and operations 1 3 5 7 9 0 20 40 60 80 100 Korea Netherlands Greece Chile South Africa India China Italy World Belgium Mexico Poland France European Union Thailand Japan Switzerland Finland Indonesia Canada Spain United Kingdom Portugal Denmark United States Sweden Germany Brazil Norway Australia Iceland New Zealand kW of public charging per electric LDV Number of electric LDVs per charging point EV/EVSE (bottom axis) kW/EV (top axis) Global EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 49 IEA. CC BY 4.0. costs (e.g. the difference between diesel and electricity prices faced by truck operators, and reduced maintenance costs); and CAPEX subsidies to reduce the gap in the upfront vehicle purchase price. Since electric trucks can provide the same operations with lower lifetime costs (including if a discounted rate is applied), the time horizon in which vehicle owners expect to recuperate upfront costs is a key factor in determining whether to purchase an electric or conventional truck. The economics for electric trucks in long-distance applications can be substantially improved if charging costs can be reduced by maximising “off-shift” (e.g. night-time or other longer periods of downtime) slow charging, securing bulk purchase contracts with grid operators for “mid-shift” (e.g. during breaks), fast (up to 350 kW), or ultra-fast (>350 kW) charging, and exploring smart charging and vehicle-to-grid opportunities for extra income. Electric trucks and buses will rely on off-shift charging for the majority of their energy. This will be largely achieved at private or semi-private charging depots or at public stations on highways, and often overnight. Depots to service growing demand for heavy-duty electrification will need to be developed, and in many cases may require distribution and transmission grid upgrades. Depending on vehicle range requirements, depot charging will be sufficient to cover most operations in urban bus as well as urban and regional truck operations. The major constraint to rapid commercial adoption of electric trucks in regional and long-haul operations is the availability of “mid-shift” fast charging. Although the majority of energy requirements for these operations could come from “offshift” charging, fast and ultra-fast charging will be needed to extend range such that operations currently covered by diesel can be performed by battery electric trucks with little to no additional dwell time (i.e. waiting). Regulations that mandate rest periods can also provide a time window for mid-shift charging if fast or ultrafast charging options are available en route: the European Union requires 45 minutes of break after every 4.5 hours of driving; the United States mandates 30 minutes after 8 hours. Most commercially available direct current (DC) fast charging stations currently enable power levels ranging from 250-350 kW. The European Union’s Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR) aims to enable mid-shift charging across the EU’s core TEN-T network, which covers 88% of total long-haul freight activity, and along other key freight corridors. The provisional agreement reached by the European Council and Parliament includes a gradual process of infrastructure deployment for electric heavy-duty vehicles starting in 2025. Recent studies of power requirements for regional and long-haul truck operations in the United States and Europe find that charging power higher than 350 kW, and as high as 1 MW, may be required to fully recharge electric trucks during a 30- to 45minute break.

Recognising the need to scale up fast or ultra-fast charging as a prerequisite for making both regional and, in particular, long-haul operations technically and economically viable, in 2022 Traton, Volvo, and Daimler established an independent joint venture, Milence. With EUR 500 million in collective investments from the three heavy-duty manufacturing groups, the initiative aims to deploy more than 1 700 fast (300 to 350 kW) and ultra-fast (1 MW) charging points across Europe. Multiple charging standards are currently in use, and technical specifications for ultra-fast charging are under development. Ensuring maximum possible convergence of charging standards and interoperability for heavy-duty EVs will be needed to avoid the cost, inefficiency, and challenges for vehicle importers and international operators that would be created by manufacturers following divergent paths. In China, co-developers China Electricity Council and CHAdeMO’s “ultra ChaoJi” are developing a charging standard for heavy-duty electric vehicles for up to several megawatts. In Europe and the United States, specifications for the CharIN Megawatt Charging System (MCS), with a potential maximum power of 4.5 MW, are under development by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and other organisations. The final MCS specifications, which will be needed for commercial roll-out, are expected for 2024. After the first megawatt charging site offered by Daimler Trucks and Portland General Electric (PGE) in 2021, at least twelve high-power charging projects are planned or underway in the United States and Europe, including charging of an electric Scania truck in Oslo, Norway, at a speed of over 1 MW, Germany’s HoLa project, and the Netherlands Living Lab Heavy-Duty and Green Transport Delta Charging Stations, as well as investments and projects in Austria, Sweden, Spain and the United Kingdom. Commercialisation of chargers with rated power of 1 MW will require significant investment, as stations with such high-power needs will incur significant costs in both installation and grid upgrades. Revising public electric utility business models and power sector regulations, co-ordinating planning across stakeholders and smart charging can all help to manage grid impacts. Direct support through pilot projects and financial incentives can also accelerate demonstration and adoption in the early stages. A recent study outlines some key design considerations for developing MCS rated charging stations:  Planning charging stations at highway depot locations near transmission lines and substations can be an optimal solution for minimising costs and increasing charger utilisation.  “Right-sizing” connections with direct connections to transmission lines at an early stage, thereby anticipating the energy needs of a system in which high shares of freight activity have been electrified, rather than upgrading distribution grids on an Global EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 51 IEA. CC BY 4.0. ad-hoc and short-term basis, will be critical to reduce costs. This will require structured and co-ordinated planning between grid operators and charging infrastructure developers across sectors.  Since transmission system interconnections and grid upgrades can take 4-8 years, siting and construction of high-priority charging stations will need to begin as soon as possible. Alternative solutions include installing stationary storage and integrating local renewable capacity, combined with smart charging, which can help reduce both infrastructure costs related to grid connection and electricity procurement costs (e.g. by enabling truck operators to minimise cost by arbitraging price variability throughout the day, taking advantage of vehicle-to-grid opportunities, etc.). Other options to provide power to electric heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) are battery swapping and electric road systems. Electric road systems can transfer power to a truck either via inductive coils13 in a road, or through conductive connections between the vehicle and road, or via catenary (overhead) lines. Catenary and other dynamic charging options may hold promise for reducing the uncertainty of system-level costs in the transition to zero-emission regional and long-haul trucks, competing favourably in terms of total capital and operating costs. They can also help to reduce battery capacity needs. Battery demand can be further reduced, and utilisation further improved, if electric road systems are designed to be compatible not only with trucks but also electric cars. However, such approaches would require inductive or in-road designs that come with greater hurdles in terms of technology development and design, and are more capital intensive.

They provide less flexibility for truck owners in terms of routes and vehicle types, and have high development costs overall, all affecting their competitiveness relative to regular charging stations. Given these challenges, such systems would most effectively be deployed first on heavily used freight corridors, which would entail close coordination across various public and private stakeholders. Demonstrations on public roads to date in Germany and Sweden have relied on champions from both private and public entities. Calls for electric road system pilots are also being considered in the China, India, the United Kingdom and the United States. 13 Inductive solutions are further from commercialisation and face challenges to deliver sufficient power at highway speeds. Global EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 52 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Recent developments in battery swapping Battery swapping entails switching a drained vehicle battery with a fully charged battery at a swapping station. In general, battery swap-enabled vehicles can also be charged via conventional plug-in charging infrastructure. Battery swapping offers advantages in terms of purchase price parity with ICE vehicles and recharging times. In particular, offering the battery as a service – for example based on a monthly subscription fee – reduces upfront investment for vehicle owners. In addition, drivers can choose a right-sized battery for daily commuting and then upgrade to a larger battery ahead of a long journey. Battery swapping also has the potential to improve battery management (e.g. to extend battery lifetime through controlled charging), co-ordinate charging to reduce the impact on the grid, increase utilisation of renewable electricity, and even provide grid services that can generate revenue. Specifically, battery swapping stations can leverage the aggregation of batteries in order to provide grid services. In traditional cases in which battery ownership and utilisation remain at individual vehicle level, more extensive communication and control measures are required to allow for the provision of grid services. However, battery swapping presents some disadvantages compared to conventional charging. Firstly, more than one battery is required per vehicle to ensure sufficient availability at swap stations, with some companies currently averaging about two batteries per vehicle. This could affect critical material demand and the associated environmental impacts, though given that battery capacity per vehicle may decrease, the net impact is uncertain. Furthermore, the capital investment required for a battery swap station can be high, given the cost of the spare batteries in addition to the infrastructure cost. Additional costs may also be incurred if batteries are damaged during the swapping process. Estimates for the costs for a single battery swap station range from USD 390 000 to USD 1.4 million, including the structure, land requirement, labour, maintenance, electricity and stored batteries. From a customer perspective, the lower resale value of an electric vehicle that does not include a battery may be a deterrent. Finally, battery swapping either requires a degree of standardisation (see Policy incentives for battery swapping in China and India), or for battery swap stations to be tailored to certain vehicle makes or models. The success of battery swapping will likely depend on regional conditions, such as supportive policies and standards, vehicle market structure, and vehicle applications. Various battery swapping business models, including battery leasing and BaaS business models, are particularly interesting for commercial vehicles. Battery swapping is seeing growing adoption within the LDV sector, including two/threewheelers, used for delivery or ride-hailing services. In particular, battery swapping for two/three-wheelers is growing in Asian markets. The deployment of battery Global EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 53 IEA.

Ashok Leyland (now Switch Mobility), one of India’s largest commercial vehicle manufacturers, set up the first electric bus battery-swapping station in 2019. Two/three-wheelers International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) analysis suggests that battery swapping for electric two-wheelers in taxi services (e.g. bike taxis) offers the most competitive TCO compared to point charging BEV or ICE two-wheelers. In the case of last-mile delivery via a two-wheeler, point charging currently has a TCO advantage over battery swapping, but with the right policy incentives and scale, swapping could become a viable option under certain conditions. In general, as the average daily distance travelled increases, the battery electric two-wheeler with battery swapping becomes more economical than point charging or gasoline vehicles. In 2021, the Swappable Batteries Motorcycle Consortium was founded with the aim to facilitate battery swapping of light-weight vehicles, including two/three-wheelers, by working together on common battery specifications. Battery swapping of electric two/three-wheelers is particularly gaining momentum in India. There are currently over ten different companies in the Indian market, including Gogoro, a Chinese Taipei-based electric scooter and battery swapping technology leader. Gogoro claims its batteries power 90% of electric scooters in Chinese Taipei, and the Gogoro network has more than 12 000 battery swapping stations to support over 500 000 electric two-wheelers across nine countries, mostly in the Asia Pacific region. Gogoro has now formed a partnership with Indiabased Zypp Electric, which runs an EV-as-a-service platform for last-mile deliveries; together, they are deploying 6 battery swapping stations and 100 electric two-wheelers as part of a pilot project for business-to-business last-mile delivery operations in the city of Delhi. At the beginning of 2023, they raised USD 25 million, which they will use to expand their fleet to 200 000 electric twowheelers across 30 Indian cities by 2025. Sun Mobility has a longer history of battery swapping in India, with over 210 swapping stations across the country for electric two- and three-wheelers, including e-rickshaws, with partners such as Amazon India. Thailand is also seeing corporate interest in battery swapping services for motorcycle taxi and delivery drivers. While most prevalent in Asia, battery swapping for electric two-wheelers is also spreading to Africa. For example, Rwandan electric motorbike start-up Ampersand operates battery swap stations, with a focus on serving motorcycle taxi operations Global EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 54 IEA. CC BY 4.0. that require long daily ranges. Ampersand has built ten battery swap stations in Kigali and three in Nairobi, Kenya. These stations perform close to 37 000 battery swaps a month. Trucks For trucks in particular, battery swapping can have major advantages over ultrafast charging. Firstly, swapping can take as little as 3-5 minutes, which would be difficult and expensive to achieve through cable-based charging, requiring an ultra-fast charger connected to medium- to high-voltage grids and expensive battery management systems and battery chemistries. Avoiding ultra-fast charging can also extend battery capacity, performance and cycle life. Battery-as-a-service (BaaS), separating the purchase of the truck and the battery, and establishing a lease contract for the battery, substantially reduces the upfront purchase cost (by as much as 50%). In addition, since trucks tend to depend on lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery chemistries, which are more durable than lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) batteries, they are well-suited for swapping in terms of safety and affordability. However, the cost of building a station will likely be higher for truck battery swapping given the larger vehicle size and heavier batteries, which require more space and specialised equipment to perform the swap. Another major barrier is the requirement that batteries be standardised to a given size and capacity, which truck OEMs are likely to perceive as a challenge to competitiveness as battery design and capacity is a key differentiator among electric truck manufacturers. China is at the forefront of battery swapping for trucks due to significant policy support and use of technology designed to complement cable charging. In 2021, China’s MIIT announced that a number of cities would pilot battery swapping technology, including HDV battery swapping in three cities.

CC BY 4.0. in 2022, and the company has set a target of 4 000 battery swap stations globally by 2025. The company claims their swap stations can perform over 300 swaps per day, charging up to 13 batteries concurrently at a power of 20-80 kW. NIO also announced plans to build battery swap stations in Europe as their battery swapping-enabled car models became available in European markets towards the end of 2022. The first NIO battery swap station in Sweden was opened in November 2022, and by the end of 2022, ten NIO battery swap stations had been opened across Norway, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands. In contrast to NIO, whose swapping stations service NIO cars, the Chinese battery swapping station operator Aulton’s stations support 30 models from 16 different vehicle companies. Battery swapping could also be a particularly attractive option for LDV taxi fleets, whose operations are more sensitive to recharging times than personal cars. US start-up Ample currently operates 12 battery swapping stations in the San Francisco Bay area, mainly serving Uber rideshare vehicles. Batteries Battery demand for EVs continues to rise Automotive lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery demand increased by about 65% to 550 GWh in 2022, from about 330 GWh in 2021, primarily as a result of growth in electric passenger car sales, with new registrations increasing by 55% in 2022 relative to 2021. In China, battery demand for vehicles grew over 70%, while electric car sales increased by 80% in 2022 relative to 2021, with growth in battery demand slightly tempered by an increasing share of PHEVs. Battery demand for vehicles in the United States grew by around 80%, despite electric car sales only increasing by around 55% in 2022. While the average battery size for battery electric cars in the United States only grew by about 7% in 2022, the average battery electric car battery size remains about 40% higher than the global average, due in part to the higher share of SUVs in US electric car sales relative to other major markets,14 as well as manufacturers’ strategies to offer longer all-electric driving ranges. Global sales of BEV and PHEV cars are outpacing sales of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), and as BEV and PHEV battery sizes are larger, battery demand further increases as a result. 14 For more information on the climate impact of SUVs, refer to the IEA’s 27 February 2023 commentary on the subject.

In 2022, supply of nickel and cobalt exceeded demand, while lithium demand outpaced supply by a small margin. Battery chemistries are diversifying New alternatives to conventional lithium-ion are on the rise In 2022, lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) remained the dominant battery chemistry with a market share of 60%, followed by lithium iron phosphate (LFP) with a share of just under 30%, and nickel cobalt aluminium oxide (NCA) with a share of about 8%. Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cathode chemistries have reached their highest share in the past decade (Figure 1.19). This trend is driven mainly by the preferences of Chinese OEMs. Around 95% of the LFP batteries for electric LDVs went into vehicles produced in China, and BYD alone represents 50% of demand. Tesla accounted for 15%, and the share of LFP batteries used by Tesla increased from 20% in 2021 to 30% in 2022. Around 85% of the cars with LFP batteries manufactured by Tesla were manufactured in China, with the remainder being manufactured in the United States with cells imported from China. In total, only around 3% of electric cars with LFP batteries were manufactured in the United States in 2022. 20 60 100 140 2018 2022 kt Lithium Demand: EV demand Other batteries Ceramics and glass Metals Other Supply 40 120 200 2018 2022 Cobalt 500 1 000 1 500 2 000 2 500 3 000 3 500 2018 2022 Nickel Global EV Outlook 2023 Trends and developments in EV markets Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 58 IEA. CC BY 4.0. LFP batteries contrast with other chemistries in their use of iron and phosphorus rather than the nickel, manganese and cobalt found in NCA and NMC batteries. The downside of LFP is that the energy density tends to be lower than that of NMC. LFP batteries also contain phosphorus, which is used in food production. If all batteries today were LFP, they would account for nearly 1% of current agricultural phosphorus use by mass, suggesting that conflicting demands for phosphorus may arise in the future as battery demand increases.

Lithium iron phosphate cathodes do not rely on nickel, manganese or cobalt, which has contributed to their increased market share. In recent years, alternatives to Li-ion batteries have been emerging, notably sodium-ion (Na-ion). This battery chemistry has the dual advantage of relying on lower cost materials than Li-ion, leading to cheaper batteries, and of completely avoiding the need for critical minerals. It is currently the only viable chemistry that does not contain lithium. The Na-ion battery developed by China’s CATL is estimated to cost 30% less than an LFP battery. Conversely, Na-ion batteries do not have the same energy density as their Li-ion counterpart (respectively 75 to 160 Wh/kg compared to 120 to 260 Wh/kg). This could make Na-ion relevant for urban vehicles with lower range, or for stationary storage, but could be more challenging to deploy in locations where consumers prioritise maximum range autonomy, or where charging is less accessible. There are nearly 30 Naion battery manufacturing plants currently operating, planned or under construction, for a combined capacity of over 100 GWh, almost all in China. For comparison, the current manufacturing capacity of Li-ion batteries is around 1 500 GWh. Multiple carmakers have already announced Na-ion electric cars, such as the Seagull by BYD, which has an announced range of 300 km and is sold for USD 11 600 (with possible discounts bringing the price down to USD 9 500), and the Sehol EX10, produced by the VW-JAC joint venture, with a 250 km range.

While these first models are likely to be slightly more expensive than the cheapest small BEV models in China – such as the Wuling Mini BEV, sold for as little as USD 5 000 to 6 500 – they are still cheaper than equivalent options with similar driving range. To compare, the Wuling Mini BEV’s range stands at 170 km, but BYD’s Dolphin BEV, the second best-selling small BEV in China in 2022, with a similar range to the announced Na-ion cars, can cost more than USD 15 000. BYD plans to progressively integrate Na-ion batteries into all its models below USD 29 000 as battery production ramps up. These announcements suggest that electric vehicles powered by Na-ion will be available for sale and driven for the first time in 2023-2024, hence bringing the technology to a readiness level (TRL16) of 8-9, between first-of-a-kind commercial and commercial operation in the relevant environment.

Critical mineral prices can have an impact on chemistry choice The variability in price and availability of critical minerals can also explain some of the developments in battery chemistry from the last few years (Figure 1.21). NMC chemistries using an equal ratio of nickel, manganese, and cobalt (NMC333 or NMC111) were popular until 2015. Since then, cobalt price increases and concerns affecting public acceptance of cobalt mining have contributed to a shift towards lower-cobalt ratios, such as NMC622, and then NMC811, which are nevertheless more difficult to manufacture. In 2022, the price of nickel increased, reaching a peak twice as high as the 2015-2020 average. This created incentives to use chemistries that are less reliant on nickel, such as LFP, despite their lower energy density. Lithium carbonate prices have also been steadily increasing over the past two years. In 2021, prices multiplied four- to five-fold, and continued to rise throughout 2022, nearly doubling between 1 January 2022 and 1 January 2023. At the beginning of 2023, lithium prices stood six times above their average over the 2015-2020 period. In contrast to nickel and lithium, manganese prices have been relatively stable. One reason for the increase in prices for lithium, nickel and cobalt was the insufficient supply compared to demand in 2021 (Figure 1.18). Although nickel and cobalt supply surpassed demand in 2022, this was not the case for lithium, causing its price to rise more strongly over the year. Between January and March 2023, lithium prices dropped 20%, returning to their late 2022 level. The combination of an expected 40% increase in supply and slower growth in demand, especially for EVs in China, has contributed to this trend. This drop – if sustained – could translate into lower battery prices. 16 Technology Readiness Level (TRL) provides a snapshot of the maturity of a given technology. It has 11 steps ranging from initial idea at step 1 to proof of stability reached at step 11. For more information, refer to the IEA Clean Technology Guide.

Beyond those materials, global commodity prices have surged in the last few years, as a result of supply disruptions in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, rising demand as the global economy started to recover, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, among other factors.

From 2021 to the end of 2022, the price of critical materials such as lithium, cobalt and nickel increased dramatically, putting pressure on historical Li-ion battery price decreases. In 2022, the estimated average battery price stood at about USD 150 per kWh, with the cost of pack manufacturing accounting for about 20% of total battery cost, compared to more than 30% a decade earlier. Pack production costs have continued to decrease over time, down 5% in 2022 compared to the previous year. In contrast, cell production costs increased in 2022 relative to 2021, returning to 2019 levels. This can be explained in part by the increasing prices of materials, which account for a significant portion of cell price, and of electricity, which affects manufacturing costs, whereas efficiency gains in pack manufacturing help decrease costs. Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) sees pack manufacturing costs dropping further, by about 20% by 2025, whereas cell production costs decrease by only 10% relative to their historic low in 2021.

CC BY 4.0. (over 25%), while NMC batteries experienced an increase of less than 15% (Figure 1.21). Since LFP batteries contain neither nickel nor cobalt, which are relatively expensive compared to iron and phosphorus, the price of lithium plays a relatively larger role in determining the final cost. Given that the price of lithium increased at a higher rate than the price of nickel and cobalt, the price of LFP batteries increased more than the price of NMC batteries. Nonetheless, LFP batteries remain less expensive than NCA and NMC per unit of energy capacity. The price of batteries also varies across different regions, with China having the lowest prices on average, and the rest of the Asia Pacific region having the highest (Figure 1.21). This price discrepancy is influenced by the fact that around 65% of battery cells and almost 80% of cathodes are manufactured in China.

CC BY 4.0. Policy developments and corporate strategy Overview Global electric vehicle (EV) markets today differ widely, shaped by different levels of policy support, corporate activity, consumer preference and awareness, driving patterns and cultural specificities. The role of policy has been particularly significant in steering corporate strategy towards electrification and enabling consumer uptake. In today’s major EV markets – including China, Europe and the United States – early adoption was jump-started in many cases by policies to spur demand, such as vehicle purchase incentives. Direct incentives for carmakers were also used in China. Many of these countries and regions are now seeing EV markets maturing, especially for cars, for which sales shares are increasing rapidly. More developed markets such as China and several European countries are now progressively decreasing or phasing out incentive schemes for electric cars and shifting focus towards other segments such as heavy transport and charging. At the same time, some governments in major markets have increased their targets for EV adoption further and are working to address other parts of EV supply chains, such as through policy support for vehicle and battery manufacturing and critical mineral supply chains. Many other countries outside the major markets have also started to introduce policy to support EV adoption in recent years, for the first time in some cases. Overall, global spending by governments and consumers on electric cars has significantly increased in the past few years, exceeding USD 400 billion in 2022. For companies, policy requirements were an important driver for electrification in the early years of EV adoption.

Global EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 64 IEA. CC BY 4.0. This section of the Outlook provides information on selected policy developments announced between April 2022 and March 2023, since the last edition of the IEA Global Electric Vehicle Outlook in 2022.1 As in recent years, most policies supporting EVs target the electric light-duty vehicle (LDV) segment, for which market maturity is most advanced and vehicle availability greatest. In 2022, more than 90% of global sales of LDVs were covered by policy that encourages EV uptake. Typical policies include fuel economy and pollutant standards; zero-emission vehicle mandates; economic and budgetary regulation for fuels and vehicles, such as through fiscal regimes and taxation; purchase incentives and subsidies; and bans on internal combustion engine (ICE)- only vehicles. There is an increasing policy focus on the heavy-duty vehicle (HDV) segment, including medium freight trucks, heavy freight trucks and buses, and almost 70% of global HDV sales are now covered by EV policies. Countries are increasing funding, committing to zero-emission vehicle 2 (ZEV) deployment targets and enacting HDV-specific policies for the first time. In 2022, 11 countries signed on to the Global Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Zero-Emission Medium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicles, bringing the total number of signatories to 27. These countries aim for 100% zero-emission new truck and bus sales by 2040. Policies are also shifting towards electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), or charging, and currently almost 80% of global EV sales (LDV and HDV) are covered by EVSE-related policy. Countries are increasingly dedicating funds to EVSE deployment, acknowledging that lack of charging infrastructure can be a critical barrier to EV adoption. The 2022-2023 period was notable for the announcement of policies in the European Union and United States – new CO2 standards and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), respectively – which are expected to have a significant impact on the pathway to zero-emission road transport. In addition, several EMDEs outside China have developed specific industrial policy to support battery and EV production, seeking to capitalise on opportunities to strengthen domestic manufacturing capacity. 1 More comprehensive policy coverage and analysis, both regionally and prior to 2022-2023, can be found online in the interactive IEA Global EV Policy Explorer. The explorer now includes policies and targets from around 90 countries, covering the majority of the annual global sales shares of LDVs (over 90%), HDVs (70%), and two/three-wheelers (almost 70%) respectively. In particular, new entries for EMDEs have been added. The explorer provides information on government policies, ambitions and targets encouraging EV adoption across all road transport segments. It covers vehicle deployment targets, financial incentives, manufacturing policies, as well as targets and financial support for charging infrastructure. 2 Includes battery, plug-in, and fuel cell electric vehicles.

Zero-emission vehicle targets are a cornerstone of policy for transport decarbonisation, and almost all such targets, with respect to market coverage, have relatively short- to medium-term implementation dates. For LDVs, around half of annual global sales are covered by targets for 2035 or earlier, increasing only slightly to 55% by 2050.

Zero-emission vehicle targets are now in place in an increasing number of countries, including in emerging markets and developing economies. Policy to develop EV supply chains Policy increasingly aims to boost manufacturing, not just deployment Several of the policies announced in 2022 and early 2023 relate to the development of EV manufacturing in addition to EV deployment. In China, the largest market for electric cars, supporting EV manufacturers and companies through direct incentives along EV supply chains to ramp up domestic production is not a new phenomenon. The past decade has seen a sustained use of supply- and demand-side incentives for domestic firms, as well as joint ventures with international carmakers. Support has been particularly prevalent at the local level in China, thereby stimulating national uptake and the development of several major EV companies. Regions and cities have also recently announced targets for manufacturing, such as Chongqing’s goal to produce and sell more than 10% of Netherlands Norway Ireland Sri Lanka Slovenia United Kingdom Canada Cabo Verde Costa Rica Israel Singapore Japan 2030 2040 United Kingdom Austria Chile Argentina European Union Mexico Austria Cabo Verde Canada Chile Mexico Chile Colombia Dominican Republic Legend: 100% electrified sales 100% ZEV sales 100% electrified stock ICE ban 100% zero-emission public bus sales 100% zero-emission public bus stock Denmark Ecuador Israel Netherlands New Zealand Ukraine Costa Rica Singapore United Kingdom LDV HDV Ukraine United States (25%*) Iceland Denmark Global EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 67 IEA.

In July 2022, Morocco announced plans to build a large EV battery factory, and the country marked the completion of its first domestically produced battery electric vehicle (BEV) in December 2022 following the reduction of tariffs on lithium-ion cells in 2021 to encourage assembly. United States: Inflation Reduction Act The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), passed in August 2022, includes various tax incentives and funding programmes to meet the aim of building a clean energy economy. Part of the Act concentrates on accelerating EV adoption, with dedicated funding drawn from the USD 369 billion allocated for climate investments. The Clean Vehicle Tax Credit introduces a new set of conditions for EV models to qualify for incentives. From 2023 onwards, these conditions stipulate that final assembly must occur in North America, and that vehicles must have a 7 kWh battery or greater (to exclude low-range plug-in hybrid electric vehicles [PHEVs]), be under 6.35 t gross vehicle weight (GVW), and have a suggested retail price of less than USD 80 000 for vans, SUVs and pickup trucks, or USD 55 000 for other vehicles. In order to qualify for the incentive, the EV buyer’s household income must be below the limit set by the US Internal Revenue Service. These conditions open eligibility for an incentive of up to USD 7 500 per vehicle: USD 3 750 if the battery meets the critical mineral requirement, and another USD 3 750 if it meets the component requirement.4 Furthermore, from 2025, vehicles with any critical minerals from “foreign entities of concern” will not be eligible for the credit, and vehicles with battery components from such entities will be ineligible from 2024. 3 The policy specifically refers to “Intelligent and Connected New Energy Vehicles”, and therefore may not necessarily mean 10% of total NEV sales in China. 4 This requirement stipulates that: 1) in 2023, 40% or more of the battery critical minerals must be extracted or processed in the United States or a US free trade country, or have been recycled in North America, gradually increasing to 80% in 2027 and beyond; and 2) in 2023, 50% of the value of the components in the battery must be manufactured or assembled in North America, gradually increasing to 100% in 2029 and beyond. Global EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 68 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Several of the major US automotive manufacturers have submitted a list of specific models that comply with the new requirements, and removing the manufacturer sales cap of 200 000 means GM and Tesla can participate in the scheme. Of the 37 models listed, 4 are PHEVs and 33 are BEVs. The average listed retail price for the eligible PHEVs and BEVs is just below the USD 55 000 and USD 80 000 limit for cars and SUVs, respectively, indicating original equipment manufacturer (OEM) corporate strategy to meet the eligibility criteria of the IRA, even if this implies cutting prices in some cases. The Act also commits USD 1 billion to incentives and infrastructure projects for HDVs between now and 2031. 5 For vehicles from approved manufacturers, with 15 kWh or more of battery capacity, the tax credits are up to USD 40 000 per vehicle. In addition to demand-side credits for vehicle purchase, the IRA includes supplyside Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credits. Under this scheme, the US government provides subsidies for domestic battery production of up to USD 35 per kWh, plus another USD 10 per kWh for module assembly. Assuming average battery prices in 2022 are around USD 150 per kWh, these new US production incentives could account for nearly a third of total battery price. Finally, in addition to confirming that countries with existing free trade agreements have preferred status as suppliers, the United States signed an MoU with the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia in January 2023, committing to support development of a productive supply chain from mining to assembly. European Union: Green Deal Industry Plan In February 2023, the European Union presented the Green Deal Industrial Plan, which has four pillars related to progress on net zero-related projects: faster permitting, financial support, enhanced skills, and open trade.

The plan also includes provision for the creation of a Critical Raw Materials Act, the proposal for which was issued in March 2023, with a focus on security of supply, extraction and environmental standards, as well as recycling. The faster permitting for facilities, including battery production, will be formalised via the proposed Net Zero Industry Act, providing simplified and predictable planning approvals. As well as loosening rules on state aid until 2025, the financial support package of the plan attempts to allow faster access to essential subsidies and loans, to compensate businesses for high energy prices, to help ensure liquidity, and to reduce electricity demand. The plan also aims to reskill workers affected by the green transition, and to establish Net Zero Industry Academies. Lastly, the trade element focuses on improving the resilience of the EU’s supply chains, opening trade with new partners and attracting private investment. 5 Also included in the budget is provision of “workforce development and training, and planning and technical activities”. Global EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 69 IEA. CC BY 4.0. In March 2023, the European Union proposed the Net Zero Industry Act, which aims to meet 40% of the European Union’s needs for strategic net zero technologies with EU manufacturing capacity by 2030. These technologies explicitly include battery and storage technologies, and for batteries the aim is for nearly 90% of the European Union’s annual battery demand to be met by EU battery manufacturers, with a combined manufacturing capacity of at least 550 GWh in 2030, in line with the objectives of the European Battery Alliance. These announcements came just as CO2 standards for car sales over 2030-2035 tightened under the Fit for 55 package. India: Production Linked Incentives (PLI) The Indian PLI on Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery Storage was announced in late 2021 with the aim of boosting domestic battery manufacturing with a budget of INR 181 billion (Indian rupees) (USD 2.2 billion). Specifically, the government aimed to reach a cumulative 50 GWh in domestic manufacturing capacity by allocating funding to companies based on the sales of batteries manufactured in India, disbursed over five years, and dependent on meeting a domestic value-add of at least 25% in year 1, increasing to 60% in year 5. This is particularly ambitious given that there is currently no significant domestic battery cell manufacturing in India, and the 50 GWh figure is 50% greater than anticipated domestic demand as projected in the IEA Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) in 2025. The scheme attracted 10 bids with cumulative capacity of 128 GWh in early 2022, and by July 2022, the government had assigned funding to 3 companies – Reliance, Ola and Rajesh – for a total of at least 30 GWh of battery manufacturing capacity with the remainder to be allocated to the next highest placed bidder(s). Other private companies are expected to establish an additional 95 GWh. The Automobile and Auto Component PLI scheme has two parts: the Champion OEM incentive scheme, which grants incentives for sales of advanced automotive technology vehicles (battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles) across all vehicle segments; and the Component Champion scheme, which provides incentives for sales of certain components for both ICE and electric vehicles. The budgetary outlay is INR 260 billion (USD 3.2 billion) over five years, and the scheme has been successful in attracting investments worth INR 677 billion (USD 8.3 billion), which will be spent over a period of five years. A total of 95 applicants had been approved under this scheme as of March 2022. In both schemes, the minimum domestic value-add requirement is 50%.

It will be important to ensure these new supply chains for critical minerals are ethical and environmentally sustainable into the future. The European Union’s December 2022 proposed revisions to the EU Battery Directive introduce new rules for the production, recycling, and repurposing of batteries. The European Union also proposed the Critical Raw Materials Act in March 2023, which aims, by 2030, to achieve extraction capacity of 10% of the European Union’s annual consumption of strategic raw materials; processing capacity for 40%; and recycling capacity for 15%. Objectives also include diversifying the origin of imported materials to increase supply chain security and resilience, and improving the environmental sustainability of mineral-related activities. In the United States, the importance of critical minerals and the preference for developing domestic capacity has been underlined by the stipulation under the IRA that half of the vehicle subsidy is dependent on meeting the critical mineral requirement. Initiatives to stimulate domestic manufacturing and ensure supply of critical minerals are also underway in many other countries. Australia is aiming to accelerate lithium production for both export and domestic downstream processing. Recent policy developments have included a consultation on the Australian Made Battery Plan, which sets out an AUD 100 million (Australian dollars) (USD 65 million) budget proposal for domestic battery manufacturing projects in Queensland, and on a new Critical Minerals Strategy. Like Chile, Australia has a free trade agreement with the United States, meaning greater synergy with the IRA than in countries not covered by such agreements. Argentina sees an opportunity to build a battery manufacturing industry that would create 2 500 jobs by 2030, and is considering the introduction of a domestic market quota of 5%, potentially increasing to 20%, to guarantee domestic industry access to lithium. Japan aims to increase domestic production of vehicle batteries to 100 GWh by 2030 under the Green Growth Strategy. In 2022, Japan earmarked JPY 331.6 billion (Japanese yen) (USD 2.5 billion) to develop materials for magnets and batteries to reduce the dependency on rare earth elements and lithium, including those used for EV applications. In Mexico, a decentralised public body, Lithium for Mexico, was created in August 2022, recognising lithium as strategic mineral and nationalising the value chain, with a target that 50% of vehicles produced in Mexico will be ZEVs by 2030. Russia is aiming to leverage minerals to develop a battery industry, and for no less than 10% of car production to be EVs in 2030. Global EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 71 IEA. CC BY 4.0. In 2020-2021, India imported lithium-ion cells worth USD 1 billion, more than 95% of which were from Hong Kong and China, according to trade data. To reduce dependency on imports, in 2022 India issued Battery Waste Management Rules, which aim at recycling or refurbishing all types of batteries, including those of EVs. The rules also set the goal of increasing the recycled content of EV batteries to 20% by 2030, including for imported products. In February 2023, India announced its first inferred lithium deposits of 5.9 Mt.6 If confirmed, this may become a gamechanger for India and for global cell manufacturing. Other countries are also positioning themselves as potential players in the EV supply chain: In 2023, Iran claimed to have identified lithium reserves, which if confirmed could amount to 8.5 Mt, or the second largest such reserves in the world. Box 2.1 Promoting electric vehicle adoption beyond targets and subsidies Expansion of Low-Emission Zones or similar policies Low-Emission Zones (LEZs) are increasingly common, particularly in Europe, and they may encourage EV adoption in the future, provided they are able to address acceptance and equity issues. London and Milan provide examples of LEZs that have been in place for several years. In London, the Ultra-Low Emission Zone introduced in 2021 will expand across all boroughs from August 2023 onwards: a vehicle driving in the area without meeting the emissions standards will face a daily charge of up to GBP 12.5 (USD 15.5). Milan has banned older petrol and diesel vehicles (based on the engine’s Euro classification) from entering the city during weekdays, subject to a fine, with only the cleanest vehicles permitted by 2030.

In France, the scope of existing LEZs expanded in 2022 and 2023, with the government requiring the adoption of LEZs in all municipalities with more than 150 000 inhabitants by 2024, eventually covering municipalities in more than 40 regions. Similarly, Spain has mandated LEZs in municipalities with more than 50 000 inhabitants, covering 70% of Spanish cities. In the Netherlands, Amsterdam is extending its LEZs in 2025 with the goal of emission-free traffic by 2030, as is Utrecht, and the government aims for at least 30 cities to have implemented a zeroemission zone for logistics by 2030 (e.g. delivery, vans). In Scotland, a LEZ will be introduced in Glasgow in June 2023, with three other cities following in 2024. In order to facilitate the change, a scrappage scheme for people living in affected areas has been launched. Similarly, in Belgium, the LEZs that came into force at the start of 2023 were paired with a scrappage scheme. Elsewhere, China has created national pilot ecological civilisation zones, which are regions for air pollution 6 The total viable resource will be significantly lower than the inferred resource.

Although the regulations pertaining to the restrictions applied are not yet all fully defined, they are expected to have an impact on EV sales. Interest-free or low-interest loans Affordability can be a barrier to EV adoption, particularly among lower-income households, and some governments have sought to facilitate greater uptake by providing low-interest loans. In 2022, Scotland offered a suite of interest-free loans to both individuals and businesses for both new and used BEVs and PHEVs. The current round of funding is fully subscribed. In Australia, the Australian Capital Territory offers interest-free loans of up to AUD 15 000 (more than USD 10 000), with a repayment period of up to 10 years, to help bridge potential price premiums relative to ICE equivalents. From 2023 in France, as a two year-trial, interest-free loans will be offered to lower-income households in LEZs who would like to change to an EV. Since 2022, the Canada Infrastructure Bank has offered low- or zerointerest loans for the purchase of zero-emission buses, with repayments sourced from savings generated by the lower operating costs. Slovenia offers subsidised loans to people wishing to purchase an EV as part of an Eco Fund. Policy support for electric light-duty vehicles More ambitious policy-making sets course for zeroemission driving New EU standards introduce deadlines and increase targets Over the past year there has been substantial progress towards adopting legislation in line with reducing emissions in the European Union by at least 55% by 2030, as outlined in the Fit for 55 package. In March 2023, the European Union adopted new CO2 standards for cars and vans requiring a 55% and 50% reduction in emissions of new cars and vans by 2030 (compared to 2021), and 100% for both by 2035. As stated in the regulation, the Commission will also submit a proposal to allow for the registration of vehicles running exclusively on CO2-neutral e-fuels after 2035. In June 2022, the European Parliament also called for amendments to regulations regarding the default utility factor for PHEVs, which represents the share of distance travelled using the battery compared to the distance travelled using the ICE. Consequently, from 2025 the utility factor (with its effect on vehicle emissions) will be based on the 2022 ICCT-Fraunhofer study of real-world data rather than estimates, substantially increasing the assumed emissions. This is expected to Global EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 73 IEA.

As of 2027, the updated methodology will be based on an even split of private and company cars, as the latter have been responsible for an even greater gap between assumed and actual performance.

Tighter Euro 7 regulations expand coverage of emissions In November 2022, the European Commission proposed new Euro 7 emissions standards for cars, vans, trucks and buses. The proposed emission standards are intended to be more reflective of real driving conditions, particularly city driving, and regulate not just tailpipe emissions, but also emissions from brakes and tyres – including for EVs. The standards are also intended to reinforce new stricter air quality standards proposed in October 2022. As with the United Nations regulations (see “Globally harmonised technical regulations for safer and cleaner electric vehicle deployment”), the Euro 7 emissions standards would introduce minimum performance standards for LDV battery durability of 80% by year 5 or 100 000 km, and 70% from years 5 to 8 or 160 000 km.7 Also included are nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions reductions of 35% for LDVs and 56% for HDVs, and tailpipe particle emissions reductions of 13% for LDVs and 39% for HDVs. These limits cannot be exceeded before 200 000 km or 10 years of driving, double the previous requirements. They represent an anticipated cost increase of EUR 90 to 150 (USD 95 to 160) for LDVs, and EUR 2 600 (USD 2 750) for HDVs compared to Euro 6/VI. Box 2.2 Globally harmonised technical regulations for safer and cleaner electric vehicle deployment Technical regulations and safety In addition to fiscal policies, technical regulations are key enablers of mass adoption, by ensuring safe, clean and sustainable operation, and thereby increasing consumer confidence. Alongside representatives from governments, industry and civil society, the World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations, hosted by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), develops legally binding technical regulations on vehicle design and construction. In 2018, the UN introduced performance-oriented requirements to address potential safety risks of EVs in both LDVs and HDVs. The requirements are divided into in- 7 These limits apply to M1 vehicles (passenger cars with up to 8 seats). The limits for N1 vehicles (vans less than 3.5 t) are 75% and 65% respectively.

CC BY 4.0. use (occupant protection, charging, safety of the rechargeable energy storage system), and post-crash (electrical isolation, battery integrity etc.) categories. EV-specific occupant protections have also been included in the five other UN Regulations dealing with vehicle collisions. Work to improve the 2018 regulation is ongoing, with experts considering the flammability, toxicity and corrosiveness of vented gas, energy storage system vibration profile, water immersion, and thermal propagation. Thermal propagation is of particular importance in light of recent instances of EV fires, which are extremely difficult to extinguish. The second phase of this work is expected to culminate in the adoption of an amendment in 2024. Environmental performance Similar regulatory activities to aid clean deployment of EVs are ongoing, with 27 countries8 committed to transposing minimum battery durability requirements in HEVs, PHEVs, and BEVs into their national legislation after the requirements were adopted by the UN in April 2022. The new provisions require manufacturers to certify that the batteries will lose less than 20% of their initial capacity over 5 years or 100 000 km, and less than 30% over 8 years or 160 000 km. They are equal to the provisions in the proposed Euro 7 regulations, but less stringent than the provisions adopted in California. The scope of the work is now extending to HDVs, a sector expected to electrify rapidly in the coming years. Such initiatives are crucial for increasing the environmental performance of EVs beyond their low emissions output, easing the pressure on in-demand critical raw materials needed for their production, and reducing waste from used batteries. A procedure to measure brake particulate emissions has also been developed at the UN and has already been included into the Euro 7 proposal. Elsewhere, following the forthcoming development of a harmonised procedure to determine the carbon footprint of all vehicle types, a draft proposal from the UN on automotive Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is expected to be adopted in 2025. Greater ambition for US states under Advanced Clean Cars II In November 2022, the California Air Resources Board approved the Advanced Clean Cars II (ACC II) rule, which sets a minimum ZEV sales shares for passenger LDVs ranging from 35% in 2026 to 100% in 2035.9 Any vehicle sold from 2035 onwards must be a zero-emission vehicle"}

Vermont, Washington, Oregon and New York have all adopted ACC II, altogether representing about 20% of US passenger LDV sales. Currently, Massachusetts, Delaware and Colorado have also either begun the process to adopt ACC II or have announced intentions to do so, which would bring the share of sales covered by the rule to almost 25%. National plans in many countries pave the way for zeroemission car transport In 2022-2023, more and more countries proposed policy to accelerate electric car adoption, either by strengthening existing plans or introducing a support mechanism for the first time. In Europe, the United Kingdom brought forward the date to end the sale of fully ICE cars and vans to 2030, five years earlier than previously announced, with a full transition to 100% ZEV sales by 2035.10 In March 2023, the government laid out proposed ZEV sales share trajectories for cars and vans to reach the 2035 target. Greece, which had a previous target of 30% ZEV sales share by 2030, strengthened its policy to only allow the sale of zero-emission LDVs from then onwards. In Switzerland a target first established in 2018 for a 15% electric car sales share by 2022 has been surpassed, reaching 25% in 2022, building on strong collaboration and investment across around 50 leading organisations through the Electromobility Roadmap. The new target stands at 50% electric car sales share by 2025. Italy’s subsidy scheme has also been renewed with a focus on scrapping older, more polluting ICEs, similar to a scheme in Singapore. Spain has a similar focus on scrappage, accompanied by support for lower-income individuals. In Denmark, changes to taxation aim to make EV company cars more attractive, while in Finland, import and annual taxes for EVs have been significantly reduced. Austria renewed its EV subsidy in 2023, applying the same rates as the previous year.11 Croatia and Cyprus12 both began subsidising EV purchase in 2022. 10 Between 2030 and 2035, new cars and vans can be sold if they have significant zero-emission capability, which would include some plug-in and hybrid electric vehicles. The definition of significant zero-emission capability will be consulted on later this year. 11 Rates for commercial applicants have reduced between 2022 and 2023. 12 Note by the Republic of Türkiye: The information in this document with reference to “Cyprus” relates to the southern part of the Island.

In 2022, Canada increased its national ambition for LDV deployment, with current goals to achieve a zero-emission sales share of 20% by 2026, 60% by 2030 and 100% by 2035. On the provincial level, British Columbia has increased its 2030 target to 90%. Having funded a charging infrastructure programme since 2020, in February 2022 Australia also started providing competitive grant funding supporting the purchase of EVs (both light- and heavy-duty) for commercial use. The total funding amounts to AUD 128 million (USD 89 million) and is a component of the expanded AUD 500 million (USD 346 million) Future Fuels Fund. In May 2022, New Zealand published its first comprehensive emissions reduction plan. It aims for 30% of the LDV stock to be ZEVs by 2035. Electric cars accounted for over 10% of new sales in 2022, despite New Zealand only introducing a purchase subsidy in mid-2021. This also covers imports of used vehicles, given their prevalence in the country, as well as several non-purchase related incentives. Japan's Green Growth Strategy, announced in 2021, sets targets to reach 100% electrification of LDV by 2035, and the 2023 Act on the Rational Use of Energy tracks and accelerates the targets set under the Strategy. In EMDEs, governments are also increasing ambition. EVs are viewed as an opportunity to reduce air pollution, mitigate climate impacts and decrease reliance on energy imports. The EV policies being introduced commonly take the form of tax exemptions for EVs, equipment and parts, as well as purchase incentives, mandates, and deployment targets. In Indonesia, government vehicles have been required to be electric since 2022, and EV purchase subsidies have been put in place from 2023. In Seychelles, the aim is for 30% of new vehicles sales to be electric by 2030 and the forthcoming National Electric Mobility Strategy will contain a target of 100% of buses to be electric by 2050. In Panama, 40% of the stock of selected public vehicles are to be EVs by 2030. Viet Nam has introduced a net zero emissions target for the transport sector in 2050, aiming to use vehicles powered by 100% electricity and green energy, with a ban on the production, assembly and import of fossil fuelpowered vehicles in 2040. Ghana’s recently released strategy contains a target that 4%, 16%, and 32% of new sales are to be EVs in 2025, 2030, and 2050, respectively. In addition, countries recently proposing tax-related policies include Angola, Brazil (following previous tax exemptions for imports of electric cars dating back to 2015), Ecuador, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Uzbekistan, and Viet Nam.

Purchase incentives are being adjusted in more advanced markets China: local action ramps up as national subsidies phase out In China, December 2022 saw the end of the national NEV subsidy scheme, originally aimed for phase-out two years earlier, and following a gradual reduction of national subsidies for NEV purchases since 2017. Meanwhile, with a sales share of almost 30% in 2022, China’s NEV market has surpassed the country’s target of a 20% sales share by 2025. The extended vehicle purchase tax exemption for NEVs will remain as the main national-level financial incentive until the end of 2023. Moreover, road transport electrification is stated as a goal in multiple guiding strategies. To reduce air pollution, China aims to reach a 50% NEV sales share by 2030 in its “key air pollution control regions”, which combined account for nearly 80% of China’s car market. In addition, China’s national action plan to reach carbon peaking before 2030 sets out a target for the sales share of NEVs to reach around 40% by 2030. Meanwhile, targets and favourable policies at the regional level continue to play an important role. In line with the country’s national action plan, 18 Chinese provinces currently have explicit NEV targets as part of carbon peaking policies, aiming for 40% of NEV sales share by 2030, with Tianjin at 50%. Regional sectoral strategies and local 14th Five-Year Plans also set more ambitious targets in some cases, such as Shenzhen’s aim to achieve a 60% NEV sales share by 2025, and Shanghai’s BEV sales share target of 50% by 2025. Several regional governments announced local incentives at the beginning of 2023; for example, Zhengzhou and Wuxi are providing vouchers for NEV purchases, while Beijing and Shanghai both announced incentives to replace an ICE vehicle with a NEV.

The focus and level of incentives are changing as markets mature In addition to China, many other countries in which EV markets are maturing are now also reducing or changing the nature of purchase incentives:  In 2023, Norway reintroduced value-added tax (VAT) on EVs costing more than NOK 500 000 (Norwegian kroner) (USD 52 000), meaning only the most expensive models would see price increases. Norway proposed to replace the VAT exemption with a new subsidy scheme, though few details have been released to date. Other advantages and incentives have also been gradually reduced. Global EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 78 IEA. CC BY 4.0.  In the United Kingdom, subsidies for electric cars ended in 2022, having exceeded a 20% sales share, after the available grant was gradually reduced between 2016 and 2021.13 Subsidies remain in place for electric taxis, vans and trucks, as well as for company cars with new tax exemptions, and the focus on charging is also increasing.  Germany and Ireland both lowered purchase incentive levels in 2023.  The Netherlands has been reducing premiums year-on-year, with a EUR 400 (USD 420) reduction between 2022 and 2023.  Sweden had first planned to tighten the cap on purchase incentives for electric cars from SEK 70 000 (Swedish kronor) (USD 7 000) in 2022 to SEK 50 000 (USD 5 000) in 2023, following an increase from SEK 60 000 (USD 6 000) in early 2021. Then, in light of closer price parity between electric and ICE cars, Sweden announced that the purchase incentive would expire from November 2022 onwards.  After increasing the incentive in order to boost sales during the Covid-19 pandemic, France reduced incentives from EUR 7 000 (USD 7 400) in 2021 to EUR 6 000 in 2022 (USD 6 300) and EUR 5 000 in 2023 (USD 5 300). However, the purchase incentive for lower-income households was increased from EUR 6 000 (USD 6 300) in 2022 to EUR 7 000 (USD 7 400) in 2023 in order to improve equity of access to EVs.  In Korea, the government promotes EVs by applying higher subsidy amounts to vehicles with greater fully electric range. The maximum passenger car incentives slightly decreased from KRW 7 million (Korean won) (USD 5 400) to KRW 6.8 million (USD 5 300) in 2023, though consumers can benefit from local subsidies as well. For electric LCVs, the incentives per vehicle decreased from KRW 14 million (USD 10 800) to KRW 12 million (USD 9 300) in 2023. However, with around 30% more passenger cars and commercial vehicles subsidised, total government funding for electric LDV subsidies increased from KRW 1 561 billion (USD 1.2 billion) in 2022 to KRW 1 676 billion (USD 1.3 billion) in 2023. Additionally, in April 2022, Korea ended their policy of free light commercial vehicle (LCV) registration, yet has remained a leader in electric LCV deployment in 2022, averaging 27% of sales over the year.  In 2022, Japan increased their EV subsidy scheme to JPY 70 billion (USD 530 million) – doubling support for BEV purchases up to JPY 850 000 (USD 6 500) and JPY 550 000 (USD 4 200) for PHEV. Stronger policy preference for fully battery electric options Recent developments indicate possible strengthening of policy support for battery electric cars over PHEVs. In Europe, for example, Belgium, Finland, the Netherlands, Portugal and the United Kingdom supported BEVs over the 201913 The grant was first available in 2011 and capped at 25% of the vehicle cost (to a maximum of GBP 5 000 (USD 6 170)); this was then set to GBP 4 500 (USD 5 550) in 2016, reducing between GBP 500 and GBP 1 000 (USD 620 and 1 230) per year thereafter.

Box 2.3 Emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) target electrification of transport in their Nationally Determined Contributions Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) generally contain aspirational language and few quantitative or qualitative targets. Including specific targets demonstrates a degree of confidence in a country’s ability to meet its stated goal. In 2022, 19 parties updated their NDCs ahead of a UN synthesis report in October 2022.14 It showed that 41% of NDCs, for around 80 countries, included electrification of road transport as a mitigation measure. In this context, NDC submissions from 50 key EMDE markets were analysed to ascertain if - and to what extent - electrification of transport has become part of EMDEs’ mitigation strategies. Collectively, these EMDEs account for over 40% of global LDV sales and almost 90% of LDV sales in all EMDEs. Electric vehicle ambitions and targets in emerging markets and developing economies IEA.

Analysis of the NDC content shows that only Trinidad & Tobago and Nicaragua have specific transport sector emission reduction targets, but a further 12 countries spread across Latin America, Central America, Africa, and Asia, making up about 0.9 million annual LDV sales, have specific EV targets or ambitions. Of these, four countries have EV ambitions or targets for both LDVs and buses, three countries have LDV targets only, and four others only have bus targets. In addition, two African countries (Mauritius and Rwanda), while not having any specific EV target, have identified vehicle electrification as a key strategy and are monitoring adoption metrics. 14 13 more countries have updated their NDCs since the synthesis report of 23 September 2022. 2 6 10 14 NDC Non-NDC LDV only Bus only LDV and bus Other LDV Bus LDV and bus Other EV targets/ ambitions NDC EV targets/ambitions Non-NDC EV targets/ambitions Number of countries Global EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 81 IEA.

Policy support for electric heavy-duty vehicles New EU CO2 standards for trucks and buses could be a step-change The European Commission released proposed revisions of the regulation on HDV emissions in February 2023. The scope of the proposed regulation includes smaller trucks, city buses, long-distance buses, and trailers, to cover 95% of sectoral emissions, up from about 70% currently. This demonstrates a step-up in ambition: the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) estimates that the new regulations could achieve sectoral emissions reduction of over 75% by 2050 relative to 2020. The revisions would increase targets for CO2 emissions reductions to 45% by 2030 relative to 2019, 65% by 2035, and 90% by 2040. Furthermore, all city buses should be ZEVs by 2030. Compliance will be measured separately for passenger (bus and coach) and freight vehicles via a system of credits and debts settled at the end of five-year periods between 2025 and 2040. Additionally, the definition of ZEV applied is changing, increasing from 1 gCO2 per vehicle-km to 5 gCO2 per tonne-km (tkm) to allow for dual fuel. Trading between economically linked entities (e.g. between brands at the same parent company) is allowed to help meet targets. The minimum range of long-haul trucks is defined as 350 km, and financial penalties are applied for non-compliance. Several European Union member countries are strengthening support for zeroemission heavy transport in national plans. Germany has among the highest truck purchase subsidies in Europe, with 80% of additional costs of the vehicle and/or the charging infrastructure covered. Ireland’s updated Climate Action Plan includes a target of 700 low-emission heavy-duty trucks by 2025, a 30% zeroemission heavy-duty truck sales share by 2030, and provisions for HDVs. Ireland also introduced its first electric bus target: 300 by 2025. In Denmark, from 2025 onwards, taxes on trucks will be based on CO2 emissions, sending a clear policy signal to operators. In April 2022, Italy made subsidies available for trucks between 3.5 and 12 t, and in the same month, the Netherlands introduced a wideranging scheme covering vehicles from small trucks up to tractor units (4.25-18+ t). Croatia implemented a scheme with a similarly wide scope in June. Global EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 82 IEA. CC BY 4.0. In total, ten European countries now also have a subsidy scheme for HDVs, five of which were introduced in 2022/23. Increasing inclusion of HDVs in targets and policy incentives In the United States, the IRA provides USD 1 billion for vehicles and infrastructure specifically for HDVs, including subsidies, and the state of California’s funding package for charging infrastructure will see 70% of funds dedicated to charging for HDVs. In the United Kingdom, HDVs remain included in subsidy schemes even though support for electric cars has been phased out. Similarly, Australia’s subsidy scheme under the Future Fuels Program specifically targets HDVs and HDV charging with dedicated funding that is not available for LDVs. Several countries have specific targets for zero- or low-emission heavy transport. In New Zealand, the aim is to reduce emissions from freight transport by 35% by 2035. Norway aims for virtually zero-emission goods distribution by 2030 in the biggest urban centres. Tianjin (China), aims to have 80% NEVs in public transport, rental, logistics and delivery vehicle sales by 2025, while Viet Nam’s net zero transport by 2050 goal includes HDVs. Japan aims to introduce 5 000 electric HDVs by 2030, with a JPY 13.6 billion (USD 120 million) plan to electrify HDVs and taxis. Some countries are also introducing financial support for electric truck purchases for the first time. In July 2022, Canada’s Incentives for Medium- and Heavy-duty Zero-Emission Vehicles (iMHZEV) programme began to offer incentives up to CAD (Canadian dollars) 200 000 (USD 160 000) towards the purchase or lease of ZEV trucks of various categories. With respect to electric buses, overall model availability is higher and costcompetitiveness better than trucks, making them generally more affordable. Indeed, several EMDEs have begun including ambitious deployment targets for electric buses in national plans, often ahead of LDV targets. For example, in April 2022, Panama announced the aim of transitioning towards electric public transport, reaching a 10% share by 2025, 20% by 2027, and 33% by 2030.

Heavy-duty vehicle policy coverage in selected key countries IEA. CC BY 4.0. Note: Numbers in parentheses are the electric HDV (bus and truck) sales shares in each country in 2022. Grey sections indicate that a country does not have policy or commitment addressing this specific area. HDV targets are separated as it is common for countries to have explicit targets for one category and not both. A country is considered to have infrastructure policy only where HDV charging is explicitly mentioned. Similarly, “truck targets” refers to explicit targets for either vehicle sales/stock volumes or shares. Countries are supporting deployment of electric trucks and buses, from less firm commitments such as signing pledges, all the way to funding dedicated charging infrastructure. Policy support for EV charging infrastructure Support is gradually shifting from vehicles to charging in some markets In countries where electromobility is more well developed, focus is shifting towards supporting charging infrastructure and moving away from more expensive private vehicle subsidisation. In the United Kingdom, for example, in June 2022 the government announced its intention to refocus on charging, after winding down the electric car subsidy programme. Almost GBP 1.6 billion (USD 2.1 billion) of government funding has been committed to supporting the EV Infrastructure Strategy, which set an expectation of 300 000 public chargers being installed by 2030. The UK government is also working to increase the availability of on-street chargers, particularly in residential areas where off-street parking is not available.

CC BY 4.0. With charging identified as the top consideration for consumers in China, Guangdong, Hunan and Shanghai, among other regions, have implemented subsidies for the deployment of charging points. Shenzhen is targeting 43 000 fast chargers and 790 000 slow chargers by 2025, and Chongqing 240 000 chargers. Germany, which is also winding down its vehicle subsidy scheme, has at the same time supplemented the budget for fast chargers. In Switzerland, the government extended its Electromobility Roadmap in 2022, with the goal of achieving 20 000 public charging stations by 2025 to support the 50% EV sales share target. Having launched a vehicle subsidy scheme in 2021, Poland is now also subsiding charging infrastructure. Finland and Denmark have recently committed to greater support of charger roll-out, as has Ireland, which released a revised ZEV plan that focuses on public charging. Additional support for charging infrastructure aims to service different road transport segments in more settings Some countries are choosing to fund infrastructure development in advance of large-scale adoption of EVs. One notable example is Australia, which has had grants to fund charging prior to 2020 and a dedicated infrastructure funding programme since 2020, and began to provide support for electric HDVs in 2022, in conjunction with charging.15 The first period of Viet Nam’s strategy includes building a charging network, without a focus on subsidising vehicles. Similarly, Bulgaria’s efforts to promote EVs are starting with charging. In India, targets and incentives are being developed at the state level to supplement national ambitions, with the Tamil Nādu government set to subsidise the installation of 750 chargers. Under the Green Growth Strategy, Japan plans to construct 150 000 publicly accessible charging stations by 2030: 30 000 of which will be fast charging. In the United States, more than USD 1.5 billion has been approved under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program to help build EV chargers covering approximately 75 000 miles of highway across the country.

In the United States, more than USD 1.5 billion has been approved under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program to help build EV chargers covering approximately 75 000 miles of highway across the country. National standards to qualify for the funding were adopted in 2023 with the aim of creating a convenient, affordable, reliable, and equitable network of chargers throughout the country. These standards will harmonise payments and pricing information for charging, and aim to ensure minimum numbers and types of chargers, including fast charging, to support achievement of the target of installing 500 000 chargers no more than 80 km apart along major routes by 2030. In addition, under the IRA, as of January 2023, vehicle charging infrastructure installations are eligible for a tax credit of up to USD 100 000, and consumers who 15 This funding specifically excludes private vehicles and cannot be used to fund direct costs for LDVs.

California, often a front-runner in EV policy development, committed additional funding of USD 1 billion of funding to charging infrastructure in November 2022. Both at a national level and under California’s funding scheme, there is financial support to build out medium- and heavy-duty truck charging stations. Canada recently increased funding available through the Zero Emission Vehicle Infrastructure Program by an additional CAD 400 million (USD 310 million) to extend the programme through March 2027. The programme supports the deployment of public and private chargers, including at multi-unit residential buildings and workplaces, as well as funding strategic infrastructure projects for urban delivery and fleet applications. Furthermore, the Canada Infrastructure Bank announced in 2022 that it will invest CAD 500 million (USD 385 million) in large-scale charging infrastructure. This is all to support the government’s target of 84 500 chargers deployed by 2029. In 2021, the European Commission proposed the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR) in place of the 2014 Directive. As of March 2023, the European Council and European Parliament have a provisional agreement for the AFIR, which includes requirements for total power capacity based on the size of the light EV fleet, and coverage requirements for the trans-European network-transport (TEN-T) with respect to light- and heavy-duty vehicles. An agreement between the European Investment Bank and the European Commission will make over EUR 1.5 billion available by the end of 2023 for alternative fuels infrastructure, including for EV charging. Grants to support EVSE deployment are also available from the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) for Transport programme. Policy incentives for battery swapping in China and India Battery swapping policies are gaining popularity, as the technology offers a potential solution to concerns about range, charging times, and upfront costs faced by EV owners. The two countries most actively pursuing battery swapping are China and India. In China, battery swapping is being used for passenger cars and more recently has also been used for trucks. In India, battery swapping focuses on two- and three-wheelers and is most often proposed for the ecommerce and hyper-local delivery services sector in which variable routes and high daily mileages are a concern. However, widespread implementation is still hindered by high start-up costs and a lack of standardisation. The first Chinese standard was published in 2021, and later that year 11 cities were chosen for technology demonstration pilots, with the goal of refining the standards, but this has not yet been completed. The relevance of battery swapping in China is further evidenced by its inclusion in the national strategy for the NEV industry. Cities and provinces such as Shanghai, Beijing and Chongqing also Global EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 86 IEA. CC BY 4.0. provide financial support for battery swapping, often as a part of their NEV promotion plans or subsidy schemes for charging infrastructure. Chongqing, for example, aims to build over 200 battery swapping stations and deploy more than 10 000 battery swapping-enabled EVs by 2023, while Beijing aims to have 310 by 2025. At the end of 2022, China had almost 2 000 battery swapping stations.

At the end of 2022, China had almost 2 000 battery swapping stations. In order to promote battery swapping, India first amended the demand incentive scheme (FAME II) to allow the sale of vehicles and batteries separately to electric two- and three-wheelers, with the aim of reducing upfront costs. However, this resulted in ambiguity around subsidy disbursement and eligibility, and incidentally increased the applicable tax rate. To resolve these issues, in 2022 India announced a draft battery swapping policy that stipulates the minimum technical and operational requirements, as well as clarifications on financial issues. A number of state governments in India have also announced support for battery swapping. For example, the Delhi government stipulates an even distribution of subsidy between the vehicle owner and energy operator and an allocation of land for the establishment of swap points with favourable conditions. Other states are providing up to 25% capital subsidy for stations that meet certain eligibility criteria. The national government envisages the roll-out of the swapping stations in two phases. In Phase 1, all metropolitan cities with a population of more than 4 million will be prioritised, followed by Tier-II cities (with a population greater than 0.5 million) in Phase 2. A multiplying number of international initiatives and pledges The number of multilateral initiatives and pledges focusing on electromobility has increased rapidly in the last decade. This reflects government appetite around the world to accelerate the transition to zero-emission transport, and is an encouraging sign that international collaboration has a strong role to play in global decarbonisation. The multiplication of multilateral initiatives is a phenomenon also observed in other segments of the clean energy sector, such as hydrogen and renewables. To increase the impact of such initiatives, it is important for member countries to ensure that the schemes complement each other and to identify where specifically in the EV value chain they should focus. Accelerating to Zero The overarching goal of the Accelerating to Zero (A2Z) coalition launched at the Conference of the Parties (COP 27) is for all sales of new cars and vans globally to be ZEVs by 2040, and by no later than 2035 in leading markets. The coalition builds on the Zero-Emission Vehicles Declaration, which received some 130 signatures on launch at COP26, and now has 223 signatories. These include Global EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy Catching up with climate ambitions IEA. CC BY 4.0. 30 governments in advanced economies, 16 11 governments in EMDEs, 17 73 local/regional governments, 14 automotive manufacturers, 47 fleet owners and operators, 15 investors with shareholdings in automotive manufacturing, 2 financial institutions and 31 other signatories. The 40 governments together accounted for almost a quarter of annual LDV sales worldwide, and close to 20% of electric LDV sales in 2022. Some subnational government or non-governmental signatories have also set specific, more ambitious goals, such as regional or city authorities and fleet owners and operators aiming to electrify their fleets by as early as 2030. Zero-Emission Government Fleet Declaration In 2022, recognising the catalytic role that national governments can have via demand signals and leadership, a group of nine countries18 committed to the ZeroEmission Government Fleet Declaration. They aim to reach 100% zero-emission cars and vans in government fleets, with an additional aspiration of 100% zeroemission trucks and buses, by no later than 2035. Exact timelines vary by country. For example, 75% and 100% of acquisitions should be electric by 2025 in Australia 19 and Israel, respectively; 100% of acquisitions by 2027 in the United States; and 100% of the LDV stock should be zero-emission by 2030 in Canada. Zero-emission Vehicle Emerging Markets Initiative In 2022, at COP27, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), the United States and the United Kingdom launched the Zero-Emission Vehicle Emerging Markets Initiative. It aims to enhance co-operation between public and private actors in EMDEs to accelerate the transition to zero-emission road transport. Specifically, the initiative opened a dialogue between governments and corporates on public support and private investment to achieve ZEV deployment targets in EMDEs, with the view to facilitate and announce agreements at COP28. It gathers companies that have announced a combined USD 50 billion in investment and committed to deploy over 2 million EVs in EMDEs by 2030.

Global Memorandum of Understanding on Zero-Emission Medium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicles In 2021, the Dutch government and Drive to Zero programme launched the Global Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Zero-Emission Medium- and HeavyDuty Vehicles, through which signatories commit to work together to achieve 100% ZEV bus and truck sales by 2040, with an interim goal of 30% by 2030. In 2022, Aruba, Belgium, Croatia, Curaçao, Dominican Republic, Ireland, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Sint Maarten, Ukraine, and the United States all signed the MoU. This brings the total number of countries and territories among the signatories to 27,20 accounting for over 15% of total annual sales of new medium- and heavy-duty vehicles worldwide. The MoU also has endorsements from regional government, manufacturing, fleet owners and operators, among others. Greening Corporate Fleets The European Commission committed to promote commercial use of zeroemission vehicles through a Greening Corporate Fleets initiative in 2023. In an open letter to the Commission shared by Transport & Environment, a campaign group, 30 private and state-owned companies, as well as industry groups, called for the Commission’s initiative to include a binding target that by 2030 all new corporate LDVs should be ZEVs. The companies include fleet owners and operators and EV infrastructure developers. The letter was also signed by the EV100 campaign, which itself now has 130 member companies. EV100 aims by 2030 to switch all fleet vehicles under 7.5 t to EVs and to install charging infrastructure for employees and customers. In total, EV100 members have now committed to electrify nearly 725 000 vehicles in their own fleets, and over 5 million leased vehicles. EV100+ The EV100+ campaign was launched in 2022 by the Climate Group, the originators of the EV100 aimed at LDVs. Signatories of the EV100+ campaign commit to transition their fleet of vehicles over 7.5 t to zero-emission by 2040 in OECD markets, China and India. Founding members include a few corporate fleet owners or users. Recent actions included setting up a broader coalition of truck makers, transport operators, shippers and retailers, energy providers and infrastructure operators and calling for ambitious targets in the (then upcoming) EU HDV CO2 regulations, 20 Previous signatories are Austria, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Scotland, Switzerland, Türkiye, United Kingdom, Uruguay, and Wales.

EV100+ also signed a similar open letter by Transport & Environment, demonstrating their alignment on the issue. Electrification plans by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) Voluntary announcements of EV targets have become increasingly common across the automotive industry. Targets may be formulated in terms of total sales volumes, as sales shares, or as an ambition to transition all sales of the company or of a certain brand to all-electric. As shown in Prospects for electric vehicle deployment, these targets often exceed not only regulatory requirements (as reflected in the Stated Policies Scenario), but also government ambitions (as reflected in the Announced Pledges Scenario). However, manufacturers’ targets are non-binding and still often focus only on leading EV markets. Indeed, it is probably no coincidence that the most ambitious targets are for the European market, where the newly amended CO2 emission standards would mean that all new cars and vans will be zero-emission by 2035. Major new OEM announcements have been made at the global level and regionally in 2022-2023.

In addition, automakers continue to invest increasing sums in electrification and digital technologies. Just seven automakers, which were collectively responsible for nearly half of LDV sales in 2022, have capital expenditures of more than USD 55 billion on emerging automotive technologies since 2019, including for manufacturing facilities.

Global spending on electric cars continues to increase Global spending on electric cars was up 50% in 2022 relative to 2021, reaching about USD 425 billion. Most of this was directly spent by consumers when buying a vehicle, while governments spent around USD 40 billion through direct purchase incentives. These include subsidies and tax deductions such as VAT exemption, and bonuses related to weight, CO2 emissions or range. The increase in global spending on electric cars means that carmakers – including incumbents – are generating more revenues from EV sales, and particularly from SUVs and large car models, thereby progressively helping to reduce reliance on ICE sales to finance EV manufacturing, R&D and new model development. While there is still a long way to go, this is an important step for EV growth and the transition to fully electrified road transport. -100 -80 -60 -40 -20 2010 2030 2050 % Renault Group BMW Group Nissan Honda Mazda Toyota Ford VW Group Hyundai Geely General Motors Volvo cars Mercedes-Benz Stellantis Global EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 94 IEA.

In 2023 and beyond, governments in major EV markets are gradually phasing out subsidies for electric cars, suggesting government spending will decrease in those markets. However, incentives in markets where adoption has been lower to date, including in EMDEs such as India, Indonesia and Thailand, could push overall government spending up. In both China and Europe, government spending has increased significantly since 2017, especially in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. In China, government spending dipped in 2019-2020 but caught up quickly afterwards: it doubled between 2020 and 2021, and increased by nearly 70% in 2022 relative to 2021, exceeding USD 22 billion. In Europe, government spending boomed in 2020 and continued increasing through 2021 (up 50% year-on-year) and 2022 (up 20%), totalling more than USD 15 billion in 2022. In China, purchase incentives, which are based on driving range, have been decreasing. Although the average range of electric cars sold in China has been increasing, and accordingly more models have become eligible for subsidies, per-unit government support has been steadily decreasing, standing at around USD 4 000 in 2022. The majority of public support for electric cars comes from the vehicle purchase tax exemption rather than the subsidy. In Europe, per-unit support by governments has remained steady at around USD 6 000 over the 2017-2022 period, but could drop in 2023 and future years as subsidies decrease in major markets such as Germany, the United Kingdom and France. Meanwhile, federal government spending in the United States has remained much lower than that in other major markets in the past few years, especially as major carmakers – mostly Tesla and General Motors – reached the cap on further subsidies. However, it increased from below USD 1 billion in 2020 to almost USD 2.5 billion in 2022 as more electric cars that are eligible to subsidies were sold than in previous years. While aggregate public support increased significantly, the IRA changed eligibility requirements for sales taking place between mid-August and end-2022. The IRA aims to promote EV manufacturing in North America, and as such the list of vehicles qualifying for subsidies shrank in the second half of 2022. Furthermore, while carmaker caps have been removed in 2023, they remained in place throughout 2022. As a result, public spending on a per-unit basis dropped from more than USD 3 000 in 2021 to USD 2 500 in 2022. The trend could be reversed in 2023 and beyond as the list of qualifying vehicles grows.

The stocks of EV-related companies had seen extraordinary growth in the past few years, including through the Covid-19 pandemic, consistently outperforming traditional carmakers since 2019. However, growth stalled in 2022 and financial markets were rationalised in the context of increased market maturity and tougher competition (especially in China with a downward price war for electric cars), and as a result of increased risks, geopolitical shocks, supply chain disruptions and higher inflation rates.

The stocks of EV-related companies had seen extraordinary growth in the past few years, including through the Covid-19 pandemic, consistently outperforming traditional carmakers since 2019. However, growth stalled in 2022 and financial markets were rationalised in the context of increased market maturity and tougher competition (especially in China with a downward price war for electric cars), and as a result of increased risks, geopolitical shocks, supply chain disruptions and higher inflation rates.

The red highlight shows the months following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Weekly financial performance of selected EV, battery and battery mineral and metal companies are plotted against the top 10 carmakers and the broader public equity market benchmark, MSCI All Country World Index (ACWI), at an index level. All indices except MSCI ACWI and for battery minerals and metals are equal-weighted, giving equal importance to each constituent company regardless of market capitalisation or share. The EV index consists of 14 pure-play EV companies (Tesla, Lucid, Rivian, NIO, Li Auto, XPeng, Fisker, Nikola, Arrival, Proterra, Lion Electric, Hyzon, Canoo, Hyliion) and the battery index of 7 battery manufacturing companies (LG Energy Solution, BYD, Contemporary Amperex Technology, Samsung SDI, Gotion High-tech, Eve Energy, Farasis Energy). The battery mineral and metal index includes more than 40 companies selected in the S&P Global Core Battery Metals Index. The top 10 carmakers include Toyota, Volkswagen, Kia Hyundai, General Motors, Ford, Nissan, Stellantis, Renault, and Mercedes-Benz. Financial performance and market capitalisation do not necessarily reflect actual profits or losses, but rather investor expectations of future returns. Source: IEA analysis based on data from Bloomberg. Stocks of EV-related companies have outperformed those of incumbent car makers since 2019, but supply chain disruptions, increasing competition and market rationalisation are closing the gap. In 2022 the market capitalisation of EV companies shrank dramatically, falling from an all-time high at the end of 2021. This drop is almost entirely due to Tesla: the company’s market capitalisation decreased from its peak at the end of 2021 to early 2023 by about USD 870 billion, which is more than the combined valuation of the selected top 10 incumbent carmakers early 2023. The company also heavily reduced vehicle prices repeatedly in 2023 to boost sales, with discounts of up to USD 34 000. However, Tesla remains the highest valued EV firm and the eighth most highly valued company in the world, with strong investor confidence. It ranks far ahead of competitors such as BYD, Li Auto and NIO, and other companies such as Rivian, Lucid Motors and XPeng, which struggled in 2022, as well as smaller players such as VinFast and truckmaker Lordstown Motors. As an example of a company that had difficulties in 2022, Rivian halted plans to produce electric vans with Mercedes-Benz in Europe, weakening confidence. 100 300 Jan-19 Jan-20 Jan-21 Jan-22 Jan-23 Index (Jan-19 = 100) Stock financial performance EV Battery Battery mineral and metal Top 10 automakers MSCI ACWI 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 Jan-20 Jan-21 Jan-22 Jan-23 Trillion USD Market capitalisation Global EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 97 IEA.

New market entrants – especially from China – that aim to capture a share of booming EV markets are also increasing pressure on incumbent carmakers. Carmakers that do not have sufficiently attractive electric car offerings are likely to face issues in the growing EV market in the near future. In 2022, the world’s largest carmakers in terms of ICE car sales (Volkswagen, General Motors, Toyota, Stellantis, Honda, Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi, Ford, Hyundai-Kia, Geely, Mercedes-Benz and BMW) accounted for 40% of global electric car sales. In 2015, the same companies accounted for 55%. Over the same period, the combined market share of just two companies, Tesla and BYD, increased from 20% to over 30%. In 2015, Chinese carmakers accounted for 35% of global EV sales, and this share increased to 45% in 2022, led by BYD (18%), Geely (6%), and a number of other firms including SAIC, Chery, Changan, Dongfeng, Hozon, CHJ, Great Wall, NIO, Xiaopeng and Leap.

Data for 2022 and 2023 are based on company and financial analyst expectations. Source: IEA analysis based on Bloomberg data. EV battery company margins have been steadily decreasing since 2015. On average, Tesla has been outperforming incumbent automakers. Companies seek value upstream in batteries and critical minerals As battery demand continues to increase, battery makers are seeing strong financial stock performance, outperforming that of EV makers in 2022, in spite of supply chain disruptions and critical mineral price volatility. Their market capitalisation has also been steadily increasing since 2020, suggesting strong investor confidence in future returns and growth. In 2022, CATL, which accounts for nearly 40% of the world’s market for EV cells, far ahead of LG Energy and BYD, saw net income nearly double relative to 2021 as EV sales increased. Financial analysts suggest that the market for lithium-ion batteries could boom from USD 90 billion in 2022 to USD 250 billion in 2030. However, growth in market capitalisation was slower and financial performance not as high in 2022 as it was over 2020-2021.

This is due not only to increasing competition in the market, but also to higher raw material and commodity prices (e.g. for lithium, cobalt and nickel), which tend to boost the profits of firms involved in extraction while putting pressure on the firms purchasing the materials for refining and to manufacture products such as batteries. As carmakers compete to secure battery supplies, they are increasing investments for in-house battery production for increased vertical integration. For example, Tesla is increasing its focus on battery manufacturing, and introducing innovative concepts expected to cut costs.

Figure 2.12. Key financial indicators of top mining companies, 2016-2022 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Notes: Top 100 mining refers to companies with the highest market capitalisation in 2022 and with a share of revenues from mining of more than 70% of total revenues. The same rules apply to selected top coal companies.

Three-year moving non-weighted averages over the sample of companies are used for profit margin, excluding single outlier data points. Source: IEA analysis based on Bloomberg data. Market capitalisation, revenues and profit margin of major critical mineral companies are increasing rapidly, especially in lithium, often outperforming conventional mining companies.

CC BY 4.0. 2021, and their net profit by 130%. In the context of the energy transition, critical mineral demand is of particular interest for the mining sector. In 2021, the combined value of critical minerals used for clean technologies was around USD 75 billion. Assuming prices stay constant, by 2050, the needs of the energy transition could increase this value fivefold in the Net Zero by 2050 Scenario. This prospect makes the critical mineral sector especially attractive for investors. Indeed, the market capitalisation of lithium, copper and nickel mining companies grew by 350%, 90% and 85% respectively between 2016 and 2022, compared with 20% for coal producers and 75% for the top 100 mining companies over the same period. This reflects increasing appetite for critical metal mining and confidence in future returns. There are also new entrants in this sector, just as in other steps of the EV supply chain. In March 2023, Lithium Royalty Corp., a Canadian company established in 2018, raised USD 109 million in the biggest initial public offering (IPO) in the country since May 2022. Competition is pushing some mining companies to also seek vertical integration: downstream in mineral processing for miners, and upstream in mining for refiners. Albemarle and Covalent Lithium, for example, are building processing sites in Australia to turn the spodumene they extract into lithium hydroxide. In total, lithium processing projects have received USD 5 billion in Western Australia alone over the past three years. As a result of mining companies expanding operations downstream, refiners are under pressure, with profit margins shrinking, especially in China where there is historic reliance on Australian spodumene. As a result, some refiners are moving upstream as a means to secure raw materials, but lead times to develop new mines can be long. Looking to the future, vertical integration on both sides of EV supply chains – from miners downstream and from carmakers upstream – could help decrease manufacturing costs and prices for consumers accordingly, but could also lead to greater market concentration. Venture capital investments in EV start-ups In the past decade, venture capital (VC) funding for clean energy start-ups has boomed, particularly in electromobility. Financial investors such as banks and VC or private equity funds see in EV start-ups a potential for future returns with high exit values. Many companies, including major incumbent carmakers, also provide funding to start-ups through corporate VC to develop new technology or to acquire concepts developed by new entrants, as a means to maintain a competitive edge and secure their own positioning in car markets. While in the past century most major carmakers typically developed ICE technology in-house, through R&D and manufacturing"}

The increase was particularly high in the charging segment, which saw an all-time high among early-stage funding at USD 730 million. There was also a notable increase in funding for battery recycling and reuse, which stood at USD 200 million, an eightfold increase relative to 2021. Figure 2.13.

CC BY 4.0. Meanwhile, early-stage electric car manufacturers are raising less and less money as EV markets mature. Start-ups developing new electric cars were the first beneficiaries of booming EV VC in around 2015, but less and less capital is provided to new entrants as competition increases and major incumbents accelerate electrification. The 2015-2020 period also saw major VC activity in China, but this has now declined as the market consolidates around frontrunners – many of which were start-ups less than a decade ago. Early-stage investors are instead looking for new investment opportunities in the value chain, either upstream (such as batteries or critical minerals) or downstream (such as charging or recycling). Companies developing lithium-ion batteries still dominate, accounting for 60% of early-stage VC investments in the battery segment over 2018-2022, but new chemistries are on the rise, both lithium- and non-lithium-based. Critical minerals VC is also booming as metal demand surges, standing at around USD 650 million in 2022 from close to zero in 2018-2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic. Figure 2.14.

As such, the downward trend in 2022 might not be of immediate concern. For trucks, the 2019-2021 period was a fruitful one in growth equity VC markets, but investor appetite may be drying up following concerns over the performance of leading companies. Over the 2018-2022 period, China accounted for 70% of VC investments in electric car start-ups, while the United States led in investments in charging, trucks and battery components. Funding for battery making start-ups was evenly distributed across China, Europe and the United States. India had a strong lead in twowheelers, the only EMDE beyond China with a significant presence in global EV VC. Figure 2.15.

Global venture capital markets are often regionally concentrated, such as in China for electric cars, in the United States for heavy-duty vehicles and batteries, and in India for two/three-wheelers. Trade in EV-related goods Given that China is the largest electric car market, it comes as no surprise that it is also the largest producer of EVs: China imports under 1% of the electric cars sold in the country.

European imports of electric cars manufactured in China have increased by almost 175 000 over the past year, though only 40% of these come from Chinese OEMs. Over the past five years, the share of global electric car exports coming from China has increased more than eightfold, with China becoming the largest exporter in 2021 and the gap further widening in 2022. The share of electric car exports from the United States peaked in 2019 and has since fallen below the levels exported from China, Korea and Europe. While the number of electric cars traded globally has continued to increase over time, the share of exports out of total electric car sales has decreased over the past four years. The transition to electric mobility is shifting and will continue to shift trade balances. Historically, Europe has been a net exporter of ICE cars (by value), while China has been a net importer. However, with the transition to electric cars, the size of the ICE car market is expected to shrink over time, while the EV market grows. China, Japan and Korea are all net exporters of electric cars, electric motors and Li-ion batteries, and are well positioned to benefit from a growing electric car market. Nonetheless, these battery-exporting countries are also strongly dependent on the import of critical minerals, such as lithium, cobalt and nickel. 100 300 500 2022 2022 2022 2022 2022 China Korea United States Japan Other Thousand vehicles Location of EV production for export to Europe Korea Japan China United States Europe Carmaker headquarters based in: Global EV Outlook 2023 Policy developments and corporate strategy Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 106 IEA.

CC BY 4.0. Prospects for electric vehicle deployment Several pathways to electrify road transport in the period to 2030 are explored in this section. First, deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) is projected by region and road segment for the Stated Policies and Announced Pledges scenarios, and globally by segment for the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario. These projections are then compared to announcements by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Then the corresponding battery demand is projected, followed by roll-out requirements for charging infrastructure. Finally, the impacts of EV deployment are assessed, including increased electricity demand, oil displacement, implications for tax revenues, and net well-to-wheels GHG emissions. Outlook for electric mobility Scenarios A scenario-based approach is used to explore road transport electrification and its impact, based on the latest market data, policy drivers and technology perspectives. Two IEA scenarios – the Stated Policies and Announced Pledges scenarios – inform the outlooks, which are examined in relation to the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario at the global level.1 These scenarios are based on announced policies, ambitions and market trends through the first quarter of 2023. The purpose of the scenarios is to assess plausible futures for global EV markets and the implications they could have. The scenarios do not make predictions about the future. Rather, they aim to provide insights to inform decision-making by governments, companies and stakeholders about the future of EVs. These scenario projections incorporate GDP and population assumptions from the International Monetary Fund (2022) and United Nations (2022), respectively. Stated"}

It includes current EV-related policies, regulations and investments, as well as market trends based on the expected impacts of technology developments, announced deployments and plans from industry stakeholders. The STEPS aims to hold up a mirror to the plans of policy makers and illustrate their consequences. Announced Pledges Scenario The Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) assumes that all announced ambitions and targets made by governments around the world are met in full and on time. With regards to electromobility, it includes all recent major announcements of electrification targets and longer-term net zero emissions and other pledges, regardless of whether these have been anchored in legislation or in updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). For example, the APS assumes that countries that have signed on to the Conference of the Parties (COP 26) declaration on accelerating the transition to 100% zero emissions cars and vans will achieve this goal, even if there are not yet policies or regulations in place to support it. In countries that have not yet made a net zero emissions pledge or set electrification targets, the APS considers the same policy framework as the STEPS. Non-policy assumptions for the APS, including population and economic growth, are the same as in the STEPS. The difference between the APS and the STEPS represents the “implementation gap” that exists between the policy frameworks and measures required to achieve country ambitions and targets, and the policies and measures that have been legislated. Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario The Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario) is a normative scenario that sets out a narrow but achievable pathway for the global energy sector to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. The scenario is compatible with limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5°C with no or limited temperature overshoot, in line with reductions assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C. There are many possible paths to achieve net zero CO2 emissions globally by 2050 and many uncertainties that could affect them. The NZE Scenario is therefore a path and not the path to net zero emissions. The difference between the NZE Scenario and the APS highlights the “ambition gap” that needs to be closed to achieve the goals under the 2015 Paris Agreement.

CC BY 4.0. Box 3.1 Closing the implementation gap: how EV policy is catching up with targets Targets and ambitions for clean energy technology deployment are generally more easily formulated than they are achieved, but in the case of EVs, the momentum is clearly on the side of achievement. Strong market uptake in 2022, combined with major policy announcements over the past year, have led to a significant upward revision of EV deployment to 2030 in the STEPS presented in this edition of the Global EV Outlook compared to the 2022 edition. The projected sales shares of EVs based on stated policies and market trends are now coming close to country stated ambitions for EVs, meaning that the policy implementation gap – the difference between country deployment ambitions and the policies currently in place – in the 2023 Outlook is much smaller than in the 2022 edition. This is most notable for light-duty vehicles, where recent policies such as the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and new EU CO2 standards for cars and vans have resulted in a significantly higher EV sales share in 2030 in the STEPS. In this year’s Outlook, under announced ambitions, the electric car sales share exceeds 40% in 2030 compared to 35% under stated policies: this gap has more than halved in the past year. For trucks and buses, the EV sales share in 2030 in the STEPS also increased faster than ambition. As a result, the gap between ambition and legislated policies for HDVs is half of what it was in the 2022 Outlook. Electric car sales share implementation gap, 2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Realising the potential of EVs to support government climate (as well as energy security) ambitions is thus almost in reach under current policy frameworks. In particular, the gap between policy and ambition has closed in three of the largest EV markets: the European Union, the United States and China. At the global level, oil displacement by EVs reaches 1.8 million barrels per day in 2025 (over 5 mb/d in 2030) under stated policies.

CC BY 4.0. The momentum seen over the past year in terms of increasing EV sales and new supportive policies being introduced, along with funding designated for the necessary infrastructure (for example, the USD 5 billion allocated in the US IIJA to support EV charger installation), have also led industry players to invest more in EV supply chains. Notably, planned EV battery manufacturing expansions are set to increase capacity more than fourfold, reaching 6.8 TWh/year of production capacity in 2030, 65% higher than is needed to enable the level of EV deployment in the APS. Taken together, this suggests that even higher EV deployment than is implied by the APS is achievable by 2030 if policy efforts are sustained and critical potential bottlenecks (such as around recharging infrastructure and mining) are addressed early on. Light-duty vehicles Light-duty vehicles (LDVs), including passenger light-duty vehicles (PLDVs) and light commercial vehicles (LCVs), continue to make up the majority of electric vehicles (excluding two/three-wheelers). This is a result of strong policy support, including light-duty vehicle fuel economy or CO2 standards, the availability of EV models, and the size of the LDV market. In the STEPS, electric LDV sales are projected to reach over 20 million in 2025, doubling the number of sales in 2022, and to quadruple to 40 million in 2030. The sales share of electric LDVs thus increases from 13% in 2022 to over 20% in 2025 and around 35% in 2030. The stock of electric LDVs reaches about 230 million in 2030, meaning that about one in every seven LDVs on the road is electric. In the APS, the fleet of electric LDVs reaches over 240 million in 2030, a 15% stock share. Of these, 230 million are electric PLDVs, with only 6% being LCVs. Sales of electric LDVs reach almost 45 million in 2030 in the APS, representing a sales share of 40%. These results reflect government electrification ambitions and net zero pledges, including the 2021 COP 26 declaration target to achieve 100% zero-emission LDV sales by 2040, and by 2035 in leading markets, which 40 national governments have committed to. In the NZE Scenario, the sales share of electric LDVs reaches 30% in 2025, four years earlier than in the STEPS. In 2030, the sales share is over 60%, about 80% higher than in the STEPS and 55% higher than in the APS. Buses Governments have made significant progress in electrifying public bus fleets. In 2022, there were more than 800 000 electric buses on the road, representing over 3% of all buses. As such, buses are the most electrified road segment, excluding two/three-wheelers. In the STEPS, the electric bus fleet reaches 1.4 million in 2025 and 2.7 million in 2030, at which point around one in ten buses will be electric. In the near term, electrification is expected to progress most rapidly within the publicly owned urban bus fleet, which is covered by government procurement Global EV Outlook 2023 Prospects for EV deployment Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 113 IEA. CC BY 4.0. regulations and, in some cases, government funding. For example, Canada is aiming to put 5 000 electric public and school buses on the road by the end of 2025 via the CAD 2.75 billion Zero Emission Transit Fund. In the APS, the electric bus fleet exceeds 3 million in 2030, reaching a stock share of over 10%. In 2030, about a quarter of buses sold are electric, which is about 35% higher than the sales share in the STEPS. In part, this increase is due to the proposed EU heavy-duty vehicle CO2 standards, which would require 100% zeroemission city bus sales from 2030. In the NZE Scenario, the electrification of buses is even more rapid, with one in two buses sold in 2030 being electric. Medium- and heavy-duty trucks Medium- and heavy-duty trucks are more difficult to electrify than other road segments, due in part to the size, weight and cost of the batteries needed to fully electrify this segment.

However, progress is being made: around 320 000 electric trucks were on the road in 2022. By 2030, the fleet of electric trucks reaches almost 3.5 million in the STEPS, over 3% of the total truck fleet. In the APS, the stock of electric trucks exceeds 4 million in 2030, a stock share of 4%. Electric truck sales increase from a negligible share today to over 9% in the STEPS in 2030 and 13% in the APS. The increased sales in the APS are driven in particular by the Global Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on ZeroEmission Medium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicles, through which 27 countries have now pledged to reach 30% zero-emission medium- and heavy-duty vehicle2 sales by 2030 and 100% by 2040. In addition, the European Union has proposed HDV CO2 standards that would require a 45% reduction in emissions in 2030 compared to 2019 levels. In the NZE Scenario, electric trucks reach 30% of sales in 2030, which is aligned with the Global MoU on Zero-Emission Medium- and Heavy-Duty vehicles. However, this sales share is still two-and-a-half times that in the APS, and over three times that in the STEPS. Two/three-wheelers Two/three-wheelers are currently the most electrified road transport segment. Given the vehicles’ light weight and limited daily driving distance, battery electrification is relatively easy and makes economic sense on a total cost of ownership basis in many regions. In 2022, the electric two/three-wheeler fleet totalled over 50 million, reaching a stock share of around 7%. In the STEPS, the fleet of electric two/three-wheelers reaches 220 million in 2030, or a quarter of the total two/three-wheeler fleet. In the APS, the stock grows to 280 million, and almost 30% of all two/three-wheelers are electric. The electric sales share in 2030 reaches 50% in the STEPS and 60% in the APS. In the NZE Scenario, the electric two/three-wheeler sales share reaches almost 80% in 2030. 2Includes buses.

The sales share of electric cars and vans reaches almost 45% by 2025 in the STEPS, and over 60% in 2030. Given that the government’s electrification targets have already been met, and that 60% electric light-duty vehicle sales in 2030 is on track with China’s carbon neutrality by 2060 pledge, the electric LDV sales shares to 2030 in the APS are the same as in the STEPS. In fact, 60% electric LDV sales in 2030 is in line with the global share in the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario. China is the global leader in terms of electric share of the two/three-wheeler fleet, with more than one-third of all two/three-wheelers being electric. In both the STEPS and APS, China is expected to remain the leader in electric two/threewheeler sales. In the STEPS, the sales share of electric two/three-wheelers reaches almost 80% in 2030. The APS follows the same trends to 2030. China also has one of the highest stock shares of electric buses, reaching nearly 15% in 2022 and totalling over 750 000 (>95% of the global stock). In 2030, the sales share of electric buses increases to 50% in both scenarios, up from 18% in 2022. While electric sales of medium- and heavy-duty trucks are significantly lower than other road modes, China also led in electric truck stock in 2022, with over 95% of the world’s electric trucks. Electric truck sales are projected to reach a sales share of nearly one-quarter in 2030 in both scenarios. Given that other countries have announced truck electrification targets, China’s lack of announced ambitions means that other countries achieve higher sales shares in the APS. The sales share of EVs across all road transport modes (excluding two/threewheelers) reaches around 60% in 2030 in both scenarios. Across all modes, the current market dynamics, and the policy landscape as considered in the STEPS to 2030, is sufficient to bring EV sales shares high enough to be in line with China’s ambition of climate neutrality by 2060, as well as with provincial electrification targets. As such, in China there is no gap between what current policy frameworks have legislated for and what the targets are.

Europe Europe maintains its status as one of the most advanced EV markets in the STEPS through 2030 in light of recent market trends and a supportive policy landscape. The 2023 adoption of stricter CO2 standards for cars and vans in the European Union has significantly increased electric LDV sales shares in the STEPS. To meet the 2030 target of 55% emissions reduction for cars and 50% reduction for vans (compared to 2021 levels), the electric LDV sales share in the European Union increases from around 20% in 2022 to almost 65% in 2030. For Europe as a whole, electric LDV sales increase from 19% in 2022 to almost 60% in 2030. Given that the European Union has now legislated to the level of ambition laid out in the Fit for 55 package, there is no implementation gap for the European Union with respect to LDVs. The electric LDV sales share in 2030 for Europe, however, is slightly higher in the APS than the STEPS, reaching almost 65% in the APS. This is primarily driven by additional EV sales based on the United Kingdom’s proposed ZEV mandate trajectory, which has the overall ambition to reach 100% zero-emission sales in 2035, as well as the eight non-EU countries in Europe3 that have joined the Accelerating to Zero Coalition. For buses and trucks, the EU Clean Vehicles Directive sets minimum requirements for the procurement of “clean” public buses and trucks that vary by member state, with average minimum sales of 33-65% clean buses and 7-15% clean trucks from 2026 to 2030. A number of European countries also offer financial incentives for electric buses and trucks in the form of tax exemptions, purchase subsidies and funding to support heavy-duty charging infrastructure. In the STEPS, the sales shares of electric buses and trucks reach 40% and 10% respectively in 2030. Within the European Union the sales shares reach 55% and around 13% in 2030.

This has now 3 Here, we refer to the Europe regional definition in the IEA’s Global Energy and Climate (GEC) Model, which includes Türkiye and Israel. 4 As Wales, Scotland and the United Kingdom are listed separately as signatories, each is counted in the European total.

CC BY 4.0. shrunk to six percentage points, with greater increases in EV sales shares in the STEPS, due to new regulations and market trends, than in the APS due to the additional signatories to zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) initiatives and the proposed EU HDV CO2 standards. For the European Union, the implementation gap in 2030 across all modes (excluding two/three-wheelers) has closed from over 10 percentage points in the 2022 Outlook to 1 percentage point. United States With a supportive policy landscape, sales of electric cars and vans are expected to accelerate over the remainder of this decade in the United States, reaching the government target of 50% in 2030. With the foundation of stricter US fuel economy standards for 2024-26 legislated in 2021,5 a slate of new measures are expected to promote uptake of electric LDVs, namely: financial incentives for electric cars included in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), allocated funding for EV charging infrastructure in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), and growing adoption of California’s Advanced Clean Cars II (ACC II) regulations by a number of states. The implementation gap between the STEPS and APS LDV sales in 2030 has fully closed due to the passing of the IRA and adoption of the ACC II regulations in 2022. The IRA also includes a tax credit for the purchase of zero-emission medium- and heavy-duty trucks, as well as for the installation of EV chargers. In the STEPS, the sales share of electric trucks reaches 10% in 2030. In 2022, the United States signed the Global Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Zero-Emission Medium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicles, with a 2030 target of 30% zero-emission vehicles sales across buses and trucks. As such, the electric truck sales share reaches slightly less than 30% (which is balanced by higher bus sales shares to achieve the overarching target) in 2030 in the APS. The electric bus sales share reaches more than 40% in 2030 in the APS, compared to about 30% in the STEPS. In the United States the EV sales share across all modes (excluding two/threewheelers) reaches almost 50% in both the STEPS and APS. Thus, the implementation gap for EV sales shares in the United States shrank from around a 30 percentage points difference in 2030 last year to a negligible difference in this year’s Outlook. 5 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed new GHG emissions standards for light- and medium-duty vehicles in April 2023, which are expected to further promote EV sales.

Japan In Japan, the sales share of electric cars and vans increases from 3% in 2022 to 20% in 2030 in the STEPS, in part to comply with the 2030 fuel economy standards for passenger cars. In the APS, electrification of LDVs increases more rapidly to reach 30% in 2030, which is in line with the government’s target of 20-30% EV sales for passenger light-duty vehicles and 20-30% electrified vehicle sales for light commercial vehicles. Japan also has fuel efficiency standards for heavy-duty vehicles, which state that efficiency must improve by around 13% for trucks and 14% for buses by the fiscal year 2025 compared to 2015. In 2030, in the STEPS, the electric bus sales share reaches almost 30% and the electric truck sales share reaches over 10%. Japan’s Green Growth Strategy also sets targets for commercial vehicles, including that 100% of new commercial vehicle sales should be electrified or suitable for the use of decarbonised fuels by 2040. In the APS, sales of electric trucks amount to almost 15% in 2030, while the electric bus sales share reaches about 55%. In Japan, the EV sales share across all modes (excluding two/three-wheelers) is 20% in 2030 in the STEPS and about 30% in the APS. The “implementation gap” has remained the same over the past year, as no new policies or ambitions for EVs were announced. India India is one of the largest two-wheeler markets in the world, and both the national and local governments are promoting electric two-wheelers. For example, modifications to the FAME-II scheme in 2021 increased purchase incentives for electric two-wheelers to cover up to 40% of the price. The sales share of electric two/three-wheelers in India increases from around 7% in 2022 to almost 50% in 2030 in the STEPS. In addition, various Indian states have sales or stock targets for electric two- and/or three-wheelers, including Assam, Gujarat, Karntaka and Maharashtra. In the APS, the sales share of electric two/three-wheelers reaches over 60% in 2030. The rate of electrification of buses and LDVs is lower, reaching about 20% and 15% respectively in 2030 in the STEPS. In the APS, electric buses reach a sales share of more than 25% and electric cars and vans a share of more than 30% in 2030. The APS reflects India signing the COP 26 declaration to transition to 100% zero-emission LDV sales by 2040. While there is no national target for electric buses, four Indian states (containing around 15% of India’s population) aim to reach 100% electric bus sales by 2030 or earlier. The EV sales share across all modes (including two/three-wheelers) in India is about 40% in 2030 in the STEPS (and closer to 14% if two/three-wheelers are Global EV Outlook 2023 Prospects for EV deployment Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 119 IEA. CC BY 4.0. excluded). In the APS, EV sales shares in India scale up to over 50% in 2030 across all road vehicle modes (30% excluding two/three-wheelers). The “implementation gap” in India, in terms of EV sales shares, is therefore about 15 percentage points. Other regions The number of countries around the world that have not yet developed a clear vision for electromobility or set targets is declining over time. In emerging and developing economies in particular, adoption of EVs can be hindered by a lack of fiscal incentives, limited availability of charging infrastructure and purchase price hurdles, but the Global Electric Mobility Programme is working with governments in low- and middle-income countries to advance deployment of EVs. In the STEPS, the average EV sales share across regions and countries other than those listed above is about 8% for LDVs, 6% for buses and 1% for trucks in 2030. In the APS, sales across these other regions reach over 15% of LDVs, 10% of buses and 2% of trucks. The countries that have adopted EV-related policies and set ambitions tend to have higher EV sales shares than these averages. For example, Canada and Korea both have fuel economy standards for light-duty vehicles and purchase incentives for electric LDVs, and as such the electric LDV sales shares reach over 30% in both Canada and Korea in 2030 in the STEPS, which increase to around 60% for both in the APS.

In addition to the new targets that OEMs have outlined for zero-emission and electric vehicle sales for LDVs (see Electrification plans by original equipment manufacturers), several announcements were made by heavy-duty OEMs in the past year. In the United States, Navistar announced targets of 50% zero-emission new vehicle sales by 2030 and 100% by 2040. In China, carbon neutrality (rather than new energy vehicle [NEV] sales shares) targets of heavy-duty OEMs have typically been at the group or brand level; Dongfeng, BAIC Group, FAW, and SAIC have set targets for carbon peaking, carbon neutrality or net zero emissions, or some combination of the three. In the LDV market, OEM announcements are most ambitious in Europe, and roughly equally ambitious in the United States and China. The corporate targets in all three markets have followed announcements of policy ambition and commitments to transition to net zero emissions by 2050 in the United States and the European Union and by 2060 in China (Figure 3.5), showing how policy ambitions can spur corporate announcements.

In contrast, pivotal policies passed over the past year in the United States (including the IRA) have thus far not translated into OEMs in North America raising their announced level of ambition for electric cars and vans (with the exception of GM’s near-term EV sales targets). However, the new legislation has encouraged OEMs to make massive investments in EV batteries and production facilities based in North America. Figure 3.5. Original Equipment Manufacturer targets and sales shares in the Stated Policies and Announced Pledges scenarios, 2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Notes: OEM = original equipment manufacturer. For medium- and heavy-duty trucks, OEM pledges cover the European Union and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) whose members are Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. The figure compares OEM targets for heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) (which, for some OEMs, include buses) relative to IEA projections for zero-emission medium- and heavy-duty truck sales (including fuel cell electric vehicles). Since annual sales of trucks substantially outnumber sales of buses, achieving HDV targets will require selling zeroemission trucks, which is currently more challenging than selling electric buses. The regional average market share in 2030 is calculated by collating announcements that explicitly mention ZEV market shares or ZEV sales by the top 10-25 OEMs in each region. Electric bus and truck registrations and stock data can be interactively explored via the Global EV Data Explorer. Sources: IEA analysis based on country submissions, complemented by ACEA; EAFO; EV Volumes. Zero-emission vehicle announcements by manufacturers tend to follow major policy announcements, often surpassing policy ambitions as articulated in the Announced Pledges Scenario. China In a market where EV sales shares currently exceed government targets, projected sales in the STEPS and APS are well aligned with OEM ambitions. New targets were announced by Geely, SAIC-GM-Wuling, BAIC Group and FAW Group in 2022, and BYD ended production of conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles in early 2022 (see Electrification plans by original equipment manufacturers). 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Europe United States China Japan World Europe (EU+EFTA) United States China Light-duty vehicles Medium- and heavy-duty trucks Sales share Range of OEM declarations (estimate) Stated Policies Scenario (2030) Announced Pledges Scenario (2030) Global EV Outlook 2023 Prospects for EV deployment Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 121 IEA.

In part this is due to the United States becoming one of eleven new country signatories to the Global MoU on Zero-Emission Medium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicles in the past year, which recently increased ambition. Battery demand Global battery demand continued to grow in 2022 Global EV battery demand increased by about 65% in 2022, reaching around 550 GWh, about the same level as EV battery production. The lithium-ion automotive battery manufacturing capacity in 2022 was roughly 1.5 TWh for the year, implying a utilisation rate of around 35% compared to about 43% in 2021. Battery demand is set to increase significantly by 2030, reaching over 3 TWh in the STEPS and about 3.5 TWh in the APS. To meet that demand, more than 50 gigafactories (each with 35 GWh of annual production capacity) would be needed by 2030 in the STEPS in addition to today’s battery production capacity. This increases to close to 65 new gigafactories to meet 2030 demand in the APS. According to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence (as of March 2023), the announced battery production capacity by private companies for EVs in 2030 amounts to 6.8 TWh, plenty sufficient to meet demand in both the STEPS and APS. In the NZE Scenario, battery demand reaches over 5.5 TWh in 2030. Assuming an average utilisation rate of battery production facilities of 85%, 6 announced capacity in 2030 narrowly covers what is needed in the NZE Scenario. 6 In 2022, battery manufacturer CATL averaged a capacity utilisation rate of 83.4% for the year.

Source: Announced capacity based on data available as of March 2023 from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. Announced battery manufacturing capacity in 2030 narrowly covers what would be required to fulfil demand for EV batteries in the Net Zero Scenario. China is expected to dominate demand for EV batteries up to 2025, in both the STEPS and the APS. However, in the APS, China’s share of EV battery demand declines to about 35% in 2030, from over 55% in 2022, due to significant growth in EV sales in the United States, Europe and other markets.

Battery demand for trucks increases significantly, reaching about 80 GWh in the STEPS and 170 GWh in the APS by 2030. Charging infrastructure The projected deployment of charging infrastructure is underpinned by two main trends. The first is that home or depot charging is the preferred option for EV charging, as it tends to be slow charging (which is more affordable than fast charging) and because these locations are conducive to overnight charging. Slow home or depot charging is also compatible with smart charging and vehicle-to-grid operations, and generally puts less strain on the grid than faster charging. As such, it is assumed most LDV charging occurs at home, if the owner has access to residential charging, and that electric HDV fleet owners will install depot charging for all buses or trucks with driving schedules that allow for overnight depot charging. However, access to home charging and suitability of depot charging vary across regions and over time. Secondly, it is assumed that public and opportunity chargers will gain more importance over time as EV adoption increases. For LDVs, it is assumed that as the stock of electric cars increases, a smaller proportion of owners will have access to home charging. For HDVs, it is assumed that as technologies mature, more electric HDVs will be used on longer-range routes. The deployment of public charging should anticipate and enable electrification of these segments. Requirements for light-duty vehicle charging Today, the majority of electric car and van charging relies on private chargers, mainly at the driver’s residence. Early adopters of electric cars and vans have tended to live in single-family detached homes, where home charging is more convenient and more affordable than using public chargers. For example, around 80% of EV owners in the United States live in single-family homes. Assuming that access to home charging covers 50-80% of the electric LDV fleet, varying according to the share of population residing in dense urban areas, there were an estimated 17.5 million home chargers in 2022. The stock of home chargers increases to 135 million in 2030 in the STEPS and 145 million in the APS. To strengthen EV adoption across population segments that live in multi-unit dwellings, where charger availability may be limited, access to public and workplace charging becomes increasingly important. The stock of workplace chargers increases about eightfold by 2030 across the scenarios, while the number of public chargers increases around fivefold.

Light-duty vehicle charger installations by number and capacity, 20222030 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Notes: STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; APS = Announced Pledges Scenario; LDV = light-duty vehicle. Regional projected electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) stock data can be interactively explored via the Global EV Data Explorer. By 2030, public charging points represent fewer than 10% of charging points for light-duty vehicles, but 40% of charging capacity. By 2030, the total installed LDV charger capacity grows more than ninefold to 1.9 TW in the STEPS, and to more than 2 TW in the APS. For reference, the total installed capacity of solar PV worldwide in 2021 stood at less than 1 TW. The capacity of public fast chargers grows at the fastest rate, increasing fifteen-fold by 2030 in the APS, despite the stock of public fast chargers increasing only around fivefold. In 2030, the average capacity of fast chargers is about 13 times that of public slow chargers and over 20 times that of private (home and workplace) slow chargers. In 2030, less than 20% of the LDV stock is electric in the APS in most countries. As a result, it is expected that the majority of EV owners in 2030 will continue to have access to residential chargers, and the majority (around 60%) of electricity delivered to electric cars and vans will come from these home chargers.

Home and workplace chargers are slow chargers that provide power less than or up to 22 kW. Fast chargers provide more than 22 kW. The share of electricity for electric cars and vans delivered by public chargers increases to 30% by 2030. Regional trends in public charging infrastructure for cars and vans Public charging projections are based on the general trend of a decreasing ratio of charging points per EV over time as the market matures and the system is optimised, while maintaining reasonable charging capacity per EV. At the end of 2022, China accounted for about 50% of the electric LDV stock and 65% of public LDV chargers. China is expected to remain a leader in public charger deployment to 2030, in part due to limited home charger access. In 2030, the stock of public LDV fast chargers reaches almost 5 million in the APS from less than 1 million in 2022, and China’s share reduces from about 85% of public fast chargers to 70%, as other regions build out their network to keep pace with EV deployment targets.

Notes: STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; APS = Announced Pledges Scenario; EVSE = electric vehicle supply equipment. Regional projected EVSE stock data can be interactively explored via the Global EV Data Explorer. The number of publicly accessible light-duty vehicle chargers increases from about 3 million in 2022 to around 13 million in 2030 in the Announced Pledges Scenario. The total number of public chargers needed to support LDV electrification in China in 2030 is estimated to be around 7.5 million, with a fairly even split between fast and slow chargers. In 2025, the stock of electric vehicle supply equipment already exceeds 4 million charging points. In terms of targets, the China National Development and Reform Commission has said that charging infrastructure should be sufficient to meet the needs of more than 20 million EVs by 2025. However, in both scenarios, the projected stock of electric cars and vans in China in 2025 is over 40 million. In the IEA scenarios there is therefore a ratio of over nine electric LDVs per public charging point in 2025, slightly higher than the eight electric LDVs per public charging point witnessed in 2022. In Europe, the stock of public LDV chargers increases to around 2.4 million in 2030 in both the STEPS and APS, up from about half a million in 2022. In both scenarios, about 80% of the European public charging stock is in the European Union, or around 2 million chargers in 2030. In March 2023, the European Parliament and Council provisionally agreed to the proposed Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR), which sets requirements for the total power capacity to be provided by public charging infrastructure based on the size of the registered fleet and coverage requirements for the trans-European network-transport (TEN-T).

The United Kingdom has announced a strategy to deliver the charging infrastructure to support a 2030 phase-out of the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans, which includes the target of at least 300 000 public chargers by 2030 and a minimum of 6 000 fast chargers by 2035. In the APS, the stock of public chargers reaches around 280 000 in 2030, of which about 80 000 are fast chargers. This means that the share of fast chargers in the total public electric vehicle supply equipment stock increases to around 30%, from 20% in the past few years. The number of electric LDVs per charging point is around 35 and the charging capacity is around 1.5 kW per EV. In the United States, the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program, established by the IIJA of 2021, will distribute up to USD 5 billion in funds from 2022-2026 to support the development of an EV charging network, with a target of 500 000 chargers. In the APS, this level of public electric vehicle supply equipment deployment is required before the end of 2025, and the number of chargers reaches over 1.3 million in 2030. In 2030, there are about 30 electric LDVs per charging point. Japan’s Green Growth Strategy sets a target of installing 150 000 charging points by 2030, including 30 000 fast chargers, with the goal of achieving the same level of convenience as refuelling gasoline vehicles. In the APS, the stock of LDV charging points reaches over 200 000 in 2030, of which about 70 000 are fast chargers. Such a ratio increases the share of fast chargers only a few percentage points, from about 30% in 2022 to 34% in 2030. In India, FAME II provides financing and sets objectives for charging infrastructure, for example that chargers be established every 25 km along major highways. In March 2023, the Ministry of Heavy Industries also announced financial assistance for upstream electric vehicle supply equipment infrastructure. In the APS, the stock of public electric LDV charging points reaches 550 000 in 2030, meaning there are fewer than 15 electric LDVs per charging point. Requirements for heavy-duty vehicle charging In general, slow charging of EVs is cheaper than fast or ultra-fast charging. For HDVs, overnight charging at bus and truck depots is the most convenient way to charge at rates of less than 350-400 kW, which would require close to a one-toone ratio of depot chargers per electric HDV. Battery electric trucks and buses with daily ranges that exceed what can be provided from an overnight charge will also need to charge during the day. This daytime charging can take place at the depot or at an opportunity charger (either at public or semi-public charging stations, or at destinations).

CC BY 4.0. can be installed at locations where the vehicle has planned idle time, such as distribution centres where trucks are parked for loading and unloading, or at terminal bus stops. For long-distance applications, such as intercity bus routes and long-haul trucking, some charging will likely need to take place along highways during breaks. Through the remainder of this decade, the adoption of electric HDVs is expected to centre on city buses and urban and regional delivery applications with short range routes (under 200 km/day), so that operations do not need to depend on opportunity charging. However, as the electrification of HDV segments that travel longer daily distances increases over time, opportunity chargers – especially highway charging – will be required. High-voltage connections that may be required for HDV opportunity chargers have long lead times, and so planning is needed in the short-term to ensure adequate availability in the medium- to longterm.

Impact on energy demand and emissions Electricity demand The global EV fleet consumed about 110 TWh of electricity in 2022, which equates roughly to the current total electricity demand in the Netherlands. Almost a quarter of the total EV electricity consumption was for electric cars in China, and a fifth for electric buses in the same country. Electricity demand for EVs accounts for less than half a percent of current total final electricity consumption worldwide, and still less than one percent of China’s final electricity consumption.

This is in part due to higher rates of electrification in many highaverage vehicle mileage markets such as the United States, but also to greater electrification in the truck and bus segments, which contribute incrementally to vehicle stock, but have a high electricity demand per vehicle. In addition, it is assumed that in countries with net zero pledges, a larger share of energy consumption in PHEVs is provided by electricity (as opposed to gasoline or diesel).

China remains the largest consumer of electricity for EVs in 2030, although its share of global EV electricity demand decreases significantly from about 55% in 2022 to less than 40% in the STEPS, and around 30% in the APS. This reflects wider adoption of electromobility across other countries in the period to 2030. The size of the EV fleet becomes an important factor for power systems in both scenarios, with implications for peak power demand, transmission and distribution capacity. Careful planning of electricity infrastructure, peak load management, and smart charging will be critical. Reducing dependence on fast charging will allow for optimal planning and resiliency of power systems, mitigating peak power demand. More than 80% of the electricity demand for electric LDVs in 2030 in both scenarios is via slow chargers (private and public).

To help policy makers prioritise charging strategies according to the size of their EV fleet and their power system configuration, the IEA has developed a guiding framework and online tool for EV grid integration. Oil displacement The growing EV stock will reduce oil use, which today accounts for over 90% of total final consumption in the transport sector. Globally, the projected EV fleet in 2030 displaces more than 5 million barrels per day (mb/d) of diesel and gasoline in the STEPS and almost 6 mb/d in the APS, up from about 0.7 mb/d in 2022. For reference, Australia consumed around 1 mb/d of oil products across all sectors in 2021. However, recent price volatility for critical minerals that are important inputs to battery manufacturing, and market tension affecting supply chains, are a stark reminder that in the transition to electromobility, energy security considerations evolve and require regular reconsideration.

CC BY 4.0. Box 3.2 How much oil really gets displaced by electric vehicles? Oil displacement through the use of EVs can be estimated by assuming that the distance (total kilometres) travelled by EVs by segment each year would have otherwise been travelled by ICE vehicles or hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) (based on the stock shares of each). In the case of PHEVs, only the distance covered by electricity gets included. The stock average fuel consumption of gasoline and diesel vehicles determines the total liquid fuel displacement, where the biofuel portion is taken out of the estimate based on regional blending rates. As a result, it can be estimated that in 2022, the stock of EVs displaced 700 000 barrels of oil per day. This method of estimation assumes that EVs replace ICE or hybrid vehicles of the same segment, as opposed to some other means of transport, i.e. an electric car replaces an ICE car. The accuracy of this assumption is uncertain, in particular with respect to two-wheelers. In IEA analysis, only two-wheelers that fit the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) classification of L1 or L3 are considered. This definition excludes micromobility options such as electricassisted bicycles and low-speed electric scooters, leading to a significantly lower stock (around 80% lower)"}

This definition excludes micromobility options such as electricassisted bicycles and low-speed electric scooters, leading to a significantly lower stock (around 80% lower) than when including micromobility segments. Whether or not electric micromobility avoids oil use is uncertain, as it might displace manual bicycles or walking rather than ICE two-wheelers. At the same time, there is evidence that in some cases micromobility displaces personal car or taxi trips. The estimate of the amount of oil use that is avoided by two-wheeled micromobility therefore strongly depends on the assumptions about the mode that is being displaced. The case of China, which represents over 95% of the global stock of two-wheeled electric micromobility, is a good example. Assuming that all two-wheeled micromobility in China replaces conventional ICE two-wheelers would increase oil displacement by 260 kb/d (or 160%). If instead electric micromobility was assumed to replace only bus trips, then the total oil displacement from two-wheelers in China would increase by just 10 kb/d (10%). However, if it was assumed that they displaced car trips, then oil use avoided by two-wheelers in China would be more than 1 mb/d higher. Including oil displacement from the two-wheeled electric micromobility segment in China alone can therefore increase the estimated 2022 global oil displacement from all electric vehicles anywhere from 1% to 160%. But there is significant uncertainty as to whether any oil is displaced at all. Global EV Outlook 2023 Prospects for EV deployment Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 133 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Additional two-wheeler oil displacement in China when accounting for micromobility segments, 2022 IEA. CC BY 4.0 Notes: Electric L1 and L3 two-wheelers (based on UNECE classifications) are assumed to replace ICE two-wheelers. For this analysis, it is assumed micromobility two-wheelers travel on average 10 km/day. The mix shown is based on findings from an investigation of e-bike use in Kunming, China. The other 10% of the mix is assumed to replace active transport, and thus does not contribute to oil displacement. Sources: IEA analysis based on BNEF and Cherry et al. (2016). Tax revenues Taxes on petroleum-based road fuels can be a significant source of income for governments, 7 and are often used to support investments in transport infrastructure, such as roads and bridges. Given the levels of oil displacement discussed above, the transition to EVs will reduce these tax revenues. Additional tax revenue from electricity will not be sufficient to fully compensate for this reduction, both because taxes on electricity tend to be lower on an energy basis and because EVs are more efficient and thus use less energy than ICE vehicles. In 2022, the transition to electric vehicle stock displaced around USD 11 billion in gasoline and diesel tax revenues globally. At the same time, the use of EVs generated around USD 2 billion in electricity tax revenue, meaning there was a net loss of around USD 9 billion. Although China has the greatest stock of EVs, the greatest impact on tax revenues was seen in Europe, a trend which is expected to continue into the future. This is because Europe has some of the highest taxes on gasoline and diesel; for example, the gasoline tax rate in Germany is almost ten times the rate in China. As the number of EVs increases globally, government fuel tax revenues are expected to decline, with global net tax losses increasing by around two-and-a7 While the share of total government revenue from fuel taxes may be small, for example it has recently been less than 3% in the United Kingdom, in many cases it represents a large share of the budget allocations for transportation infrastructure. -1.40 -1.20 -1.00 -0.80 -0.60 -0.40 -0.20 0.00 Car trips (100%) L1/L3 trips (100%) Bus trips (100%) Mix: car (25%), bus (55%), L1/L3 (10%) Assuming micromobility replaces: mb/d Electric two-wheelers (L1 and L3) Additional oil displacement from electric micromobility Global EV Outlook 2023 Prospects for EV deployment Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 134 IEA.

However, this value is based on federal tax rates and thus does not represent the full impact at the state level. In 2022, the state tax rate on gasoline was on average around 70% higher than federal rate. Figure 3.14. Net tax implications of electric vehicle adoption by region, 2022-2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Notes: STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; APS = Announced Pledges Scenario. Fuel tax rates are assumed to remain constant. Only federal tax rates are included. Sources: Analysis based on tax rates from IEA Energy Prices. Additional tax revenue from electricity demand is not sufficient to balance the effects of displaced oil product consumption on fuel tax revenues. Governments need to anticipate a reduction in fuel tax revenues and develop new tax strategies to maintain revenue levels without discouraging the adoption of EVs. In the short-term, governments can increase tax rates to balance the decline in fossil fuel use, for example through a fuel tax escalator. However, this type of measure can be politically unpopular and create equity issues, especially in times of relatively high oil prices. Longer-term measures to stabilise tax revenues that involve deeper reforms in tax schemes should be gradually phased in to allow for smooth adaptation to new vehicle technologies. For example, these reforms could include coupling higher taxes on carbon-intensive fuels with distance-based charges. While comprehensive tax reform can also address vehicle taxes (including vehicle -120 -100 -80 -60 -40 -20 20 STEPS APS STEPS APS 2025 USD billion China Europe United States Other Net tax loss Global EV Outlook 2023 Prospects for EV deployment Catching up with climate ambitions PAGE | 135 IEA. CC BY 4.0. weight-based taxes), an increase in taxes on EVs should only take place when the EV market is fairly mature, ideally when price parity has been reached. Importantly, widespread EV adoption will reduce air pollution and GHG emissions, which should reduce health and environmental damage and their associated societal costs. In addition, distance-based charges, such as those that vary by time, place and vehicle type, could also reduce traffic congestion, noise and road infrastructure damage. Greenhouse gas emissions In 2022, EVs enabled a net reduction of about 80 Mt of GHG emissions, on a wellto-wheels basis. The biggest savings were achieved from EVs in China, where almost 30% of global emissions reductions come from the electrification of passenger cars in China. As the EV fleet continues to grow, it will contribute to further reducing GHG emissions on well-to-wheel basis through 2030. The net GHG benefit of EVs increases over time as the electricity sector is decarbonised. The global average GHG intensity of electricity generation and delivery falls from 2022 to 2030 by 28% in the STEPS, and by 37% in the APS. In the STEPS, the net GHG emissions avoided through the use of EVs reaches nearly 700 Mt CO2-equivalent in 2030. The production of electricity to fuel the EV fleet in 2030 in the STEPS results in 290 Mt CO2-eq emissions, but this is more than offset by the avoidance of 980 Mt CO2-eq that would have been emitted from an equivalent ICE vehicle fleet. In the APS, the GHG emissions reduction benefit of EV adoption increases further, due to both a higher stock of EVs and a lower GHG intensity of electricity generation. The net GHG emissions avoided in 2030 are over 770 Mt CO2-eq. In the STEPS and the APS, electric LDVs as a segment contribute the majority of emissions avoided from 2022-2030, and the two/three-wheelers segment forms the next largest contributor.

CC BY 4.0. Abstract The Global EV Outlook is an annual publication that identifies and assesses recent developments in electric mobility across the globe. It is developed with the support of members of the Electric Vehicles Initiative (EVI). Combining analysis of historical data with projections – now extended to 2035 – the report examines key areas of interest such as the deployment of electric vehicles and charging infrastructure, battery demand, investment trends, and related policy developments in major and emerging markets. It also considers what wider EV adoption means for electricity and oil consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The report includes analysis of lessons learned from leading markets, providing information for policy makers and stakeholders on policy frameworks and market systems that support electric vehicle uptake. This edition also features analysis of electric vehicle affordability, second-hand markets, lifecycle emissions of electric cars and their batteries, and grid impacts from charging medium- and heavy-duty electric trucks. Two online tools are made available alongside the report: the Global EV Data Explorer and the Global EV Policy Explorer, which allow users to interactively explore EV statistics and projections, and policy measures worldwide.

CC BY 4.0. Executive summary Growth in electric car sales remains robust as major markets progress and emerging economies ramp up Electric car sales keep rising and could reach around 17 million in 2024, accounting for more than one in five cars sold worldwide. Electric cars continue to make progress towards becoming a mass-market product in a larger number of countries. Tight margins, volatile battery metal prices, high inflation, and the phase-out of purchase incentives in some countries have sparked concerns about the industry’s pace of growth, but global sales data remain strong. In the first quarter of 2024, electric car sales grew by around 25% compared with the first quarter of 2023, similar to the year-on-year growth seen in the same period in 2022. In 2024, the market share of electric cars could reach up to 45% in China, 25% in Europe and over 11% in the United States, underpinned by competition among manufacturers, falling battery and car prices, and ongoing policy support. Growth expectations for 2024 build on a record year: in 2023, global sales of electric cars neared 14 million, reaching 18% of all cars sold. This is up from 14% in 2022. Electric car sales in 2023 were 3.5 million higher than in 2022, a 35% year-on-year increase. This indicates robust growth even as many major markets enter a new phase, with uptake shifting from early adopters to the mass market. Over 250 000 electric cars were sold every week last year, more than the number sold in a year just a decade ago. Chinese carmakers produced more than half of all electric cars sold worldwide in 2023, despite accounting for just 10% of global sales of cars with internal combustion engines. The pace at which electric car sales pick up in emerging and developing economies outside China will determine their global success. The vast majority of electric car sales in 2023 were in China (60%), Europe (25%) and the United States (10%). By comparison, these regions accounted for around 65% of total car sales worldwide, showing that sales of electric models remain more geographically concentrated than those of conventional ones. While electric car sales in emerging economies have been lagging those in the three big markets, growth picked up in 2023 in countries such as Viet Nam (around 15% of all cars sold) and Thailand (10%). In emerging economies with large car markets, shares are still relatively low, but several factors point to further growth. Policy measures such as purchase subsidies and incentives for electric vehicle (EV) and battery manufacturing are playing a key role. In India (where electric cars have a 2% market share), the Production Linked Incentives (PLI) Scheme is supporting domestic manufacturing. In Brazil (3% share), Indonesia, Malaysia (2% share Global EV Outlook 2024 Executive Summary PAGE | 12 IEA. CC BY 4.0. each), and Thailand, cheaper models, mainly from Chinese brands, are underpinning uptake. In Mexico, EV supply chains are rapidly developing, stimulated by access to subsidies from the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

Policy support is boosting industry investment, building confidence that rapid electrification will continue Every other car sold globally in 2035 is set to be electric based on today’s energy, climate and industrial policy settings, as reflected in the IEA’s Stated Policies Scenario. This has significant impacts on the car fleet. As soon as 2030, almost one in three cars on the roads in China is electric in this scenario, and almost one in five in both the United States and European Union. The rapid uptake of EVs of all types – cars, vans, trucks, buses and two/three-wheelers – avoids 6 million barrels per day (mb/d) of oil demand in the Stated Policies Scenario in 2030, and over 10 mb/d in 2035. This is equivalent to the amount of oil used for road transport in the United States today. Recent policy developments continue to reinforce expectations for swift electrification, such as new emissions standards adopted in Canada, the European Union and the United States over the past year. Industrial incentives – such as those in the US IRA, the EU Net Zero Industry Act, China’s 14th Five-Year Plan, and India’s PLI scheme – also encourage adding value and creating jobs across EV supply chains in those economies. If all the national energy and climate targets made by governments are met in full and on time, as in the Announced Pledges Scenario, two-thirds of all vehicles sold in 2035 could be electric, avoiding around 12 mb/d of oil. Expectations of strong growth are bolstering investment in the EV supply chain. Recent reporting shows that from 2022 to 2023, investment announcements in EV and battery manufacturing totalled almost USD 500 billion, of which around 40% has been committed. Over 20 major car manufacturers, representing more than 90% of global car sales in 2023, have set electrification targets. Taking the targets of all the largest automakers together, more than 40 million electric cars could be sold in 2030, which would meet the level of deployment projected under today’s policy settings. Enough battery manufacturing capacity has reached a final investment decision to deliver on announced pledges from automakers and governments globally. Thanks to high levels of investment in the past 5 years, global EV battery manufacturing capacity far exceeded demand in 2023, at around 2.2 terawatt-hours and 750 gigawatt-hours, respectively. Demand is likely to grow quickly: up seven times by 2035 compared with 2023 in the Stated Policies Scenario, nine times in the Announced Pledges Scenario, and 12 times in the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, which lays out a pathway to reach net zero energy sector emissions by mid-century. Manufacturing capacity appears capable of keeping pace with demand: committed and existing battery manufacturing Global EV Outlook 2024 Executive Summary PAGE | 13 IEA. CC BY 4.0. capacity alone are practically aligned with the needs in a net zero pathway in 2030. Such prospects are opening significant opportunities across the supply chain for battery and mining companies, including in emerging markets outside China, although surplus capacity has been hurting margins and may lead to further market consolidation. The pace of the transition to electric vehicles hinges on their affordability Electric cars are getting cheaper as competition intensifies, particularly in China, but they remain more expensive than cars with internal combustion engines in other markets. A rapid transition to EVs will require bringing to market more affordable models. In China, we estimate that more than 60% of electric cars sold in 2023 were already cheaper than their average combustion engine equivalent. However, electric cars remain 10% to 50% more expensive than combustion engine equivalents in Europe and the United States, depending on the country and car segment. In 2023, two-thirds of available electric models globally were large cars, pick-up trucks or sports utility vehicles, pushing up average prices. When exactly price parity is reached is subject to a range of market variables, but current trends suggest that it could be reached by 2030 in major EV markets outside China for most models. The pricing strategies of car manufacturers will be crucial for improving affordability, as will the pace of EV battery price decline. Turmoil in battery metal markets in 2022 led to the first price increase for lithium-ion packs, which became 7% more expensive than in 2021. In 2023, however, the prices of the key metals used to make batteries dropped, leading to a near-14% fall in pack prices"}

In 2023, however, the prices of the key metals used to make batteries dropped, leading to a near-14% fall in pack prices year-on-year. China still supplies the cheapest batteries, but prices across regions are converging as batteries become a globalised commodity. Lithium-ironphosphate batteries – which are significantly cheaper than those based on lithium, nickel, manganese and cobalt oxide – accounted for over 40% of global EV sales by capacity in 2023, more than double their share in 2020. Looking ahead, technological innovation will remain important for scaling up novel designs and chemistries such as sodium-ion batteries, which could cost as much as 20% less than lithium-based batteries without requiring any lithium. In developing economies outside China, more affordable electric car models are arriving, and the future of electric two- and three-wheelers already looks bright. In 2023, 55% to 95% of the electric car sales across major emerging and developing economies were large models that are unaffordable for the average consumer, hindering mass-market uptake. However, smaller and much more affordable models launched in 2022 and 2023 have quickly become bestsellers, especially those by Chinese carmakers expanding overseas. Affordable electric two- and three-wheelers are also already available, helping deliver immediate Global EV Outlook 2024 Executive Summary PAGE | 14 IEA. CC BY 4.0. benefits such as improved air quality and emissions reductions. Around 1.3 million electric two-wheelers were sold in India and Southeast Asia in 2023, accounting for 5% and 3% of total sales, respectively. One in five three-wheelers sold globally in 2023 was electric, and nearly 60% of those sold in India, boosted by the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME II) subsidy scheme. As electric vehicle markets mature, second-hand electric cars will become more widely available. In 2023, the market size for used electric cars was around 800 000 in China, 400 000 in the United States, and over 450 000 across France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The prices of used electric cars are falling quickly and becoming competitive with combustion engine equivalents. Looking ahead, international trade of used electric cars is also expected to increase, including to emerging and developing economies outside of China. The battery recycling industry is getting ready for the 2030s. Recycling and reuse are needed for supply chain sustainability and security. Many technology developers are seeking to position themselves in EV end-of-life markets, but planned locations do not always align with where EV retirement may occur. Global battery recycling capacity reached 300 gigawatt-hours in 2023. If all announced projects materialise, it could exceed 1 500 gigawatt-hours in 2030, of which 70% would be in China. Globally, announced recycling capacity is more than three times the supply of batteries that could potentially be recycled in 2030, as EVs reach their end of life in the Announced Pledges Scenario. However, EV battery retirement is expected to grow rapidly from the second half of the 2030s. The roll-out of public charging needs to keep pace with EV sales The global number of installed public charging points was up 40% in 2023 relative to 2022, and growth for fast chargers outpaced that of slower ones. In major EV markets, the deployment of charging points is continuing apace thanks to targeted policies. Broad, affordable access to public charging infrastructure will be needed for a mass-market switch to electric transport and to enable longer journeys – even if most charging continues to take place privately in residential and workplace settings. To reach EV deployment levels in the Announced Policies Scenario, public charging needs to increase sixfold by 2035. As more electric heavy-duty vehicles such as trucks and large buses hit the road, dedicated and flexible charging is needed. In 2023, electric buses accounted for 3% of total bus sales. Electric truck sales jumped 35% compared with 2022, accounting for about 3% of truck sales in China and 1.5% in Europe. Under today’s policy settings, the stock of electric buses increases sevenfold by 2035 and that of electric trucks around thirtyfold, supported by tougher emissions Global EV Outlook 2024 Executive Summary PAGE | 15 IEA.

Increasing heavy-duty charging has important implications for expanding and operating electrical grids, with opportunities for greater flexibility and renewables integration. Policy support, careful planning and co-ordination will be essential to ensure a secure, affordable and low-emissions supply of electricity with limited strain on local grids. Global EV Outlook 2024 Electric Vehicles Initiative PAGE | 16 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Electric Vehicles Initiative The Electric Vehicles Initiative (EVI) is a multi-governmental policy forum established in 2010 under the Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM). Recognising the opportunities offered by EVs, the EVI is dedicated to accelerating the adoption of EVs worldwide. To do so, it strives to better understand the policy challenges related to electric mobility, to help governments address them and to serve as a platform for knowledge-sharing among government policy makers. The EVI also facilitates exchanges between government policy makers and a variety of other partners on topics important for the transition to electric mobility, such as charging infrastructure and grid integration as well as EV battery supply chains. The International Energy Agency serves as the co-ordinator of the initiative. Governments that have been active in the EVI in the 2023-24 period include Canada, Chile, People’s Republic of China (hereafter “China”), Finland, France, Germany, India, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, United Kingdom and United States. Canada, China, the Netherlands and the United States are the co-leads of the initiative. The Global EV Outlook annual series is the flagship publication of the EVI. It is dedicated to tracking and monitoring the progress of electric mobility worldwide and to informing policy makers on how to best accelerate electrification of the road transport sector.

Trends in electric cars Electric car sales Nearly one in five cars sold in 2023 was electric Electric car sales neared 14 million in 2023, 95% of which were in China, Europe and the United States Almost 14 million new electric cars1 were registered globally in 2023, bringing their total number on the roads to 40 million, closely tracking the sales forecast from the 2023 edition of the Global EV Outlook (GEVO-2023). Electric car sales in 2023 were 3.5 million higher than in 2022, a 35% year-on-year increase. This is more than six times higher than in 2018, just 5 years earlier. In 2023, there were over 250 000 new registrations per week, which is more than the annual total in 2013, ten years earlier. Electric cars accounted for around 18% of all cars sold in 2023, up from 14% in 2022 and only 2% 5 years earlier, in 2018. These trends indicate that growth remains robust as electric car markets mature. Battery electric cars accounted for 70% of the electric car stock in 2023.

In these countries, electric cars account for a large share of local car markets: more than one in three new car registrations in China was electric in 2023, over one in five in Europe, and one in ten in the United States. However, sales remain limited elsewhere, even in countries with developed car markets such as Japan and India. As a result of sales concentration, the global electric car stock is also increasingly concentrated. Nevertheless, China, Europe and the United States also represent around twothirds of total car sales and stocks, meaning that the EV transition in these markets has major repercussions in terms of global trends. In China, the number of new electric car registrations reached 8.1 million in 2023, increasing by 35% relative to 2022. Increasing electric car sales were the main reason for growth in the overall car market, which contracted by 8% for conventional (internal combustion engine) cars but grew by 5% in total, indicating that electric car sales are continuing to perform as the market matures. The year 2023 was the first in which China’s New Energy Vehicle (NEV) 3 industry ran without support from national subsidies for EV purchases, which have facilitated expansion of the market for more than a decade. Tax exemption for EV purchases and non-financial support remain in place, after an extension, as the automotive industry is seen as one of the key drivers of economic growth. Some province-led support and investment also remains in place and plays an important role in China’s EV landscape. As the market matures, the industry is entering a phase marked by increased price competition and consolidation. In addition, China exported over 4 million cars in 2023, making it the largest auto exporter in the world, among which 1.2 million were EVs. This is markedly more than the previous year – car exports were almost 65% higher than in 2022, and electric car exports were 80% higher. The main export markets for these vehicles were Europe and countries in the Asia Pacific region, such as Thailand and Australia. In the United States, new electric car registrations totalled 1.4 million in 2023, increasing by more than 40% compared to 2022. While relative annual growth in 2023 was slower than in the preceding two years, demand for electric cars and absolute growth remained strong. The revised qualifications for the Clean Vehicle Tax Credit, alongside electric car price cuts, meant that some popular EV models became eligible for credit in 2023. Sales of the Tesla Model Y, for example, increased 50% compared to 2022 after it became eligible for the full USD 7 500 tax credit. Overall, the new criteria established by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) 2 Throughout this report, unless otherwise specified, regional groupings refer to those described in the Annex. 3 In the Chinese context, the term New Energy Vehicles (NEVs) includes BEVs, PHEVs and FCEVs. Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in electric cars PAGE | 19 IEA. CC BY 4.0. appear to have supported sales in 2023, despite earlier concerns that tighter domestic content requirements for EV and battery manufacturing could create immediate bottlenecks or delays, such as for the Ford F-150 Lightning. As of 2024, new guidance for the tax credits means the number of eligible models has fallen to less than 30 from about 45,4 including several trim levels of the Tesla Model 3 becoming ineligible. However, in 2023 and 2024, leasing business models enable electric cars to qualify for the tax credits even if they do not fully meet the requirements, as leased cars can qualify for a less strict commercial vehicle tax credit and these tax credit savings can be passed to lease-holders. Such strategies have also contributed to sustained electric car roll-out. In Europe, new electric car registrations reached nearly 3.2 million in 2023, increasing by almost 20% relative to 2022. In the European Union, sales amounted to 2.4 million, with similar growth rates. As in China, the high rates of electric car sales seen in Europe suggest that growth remains robust as markets mature, and several European countries reached important milestones in 2023. Germany, for example, became the third country after China and the United States to record half a million new battery electric car registrations in a single year, with 18% of car sales being battery electric (and another 6% plug-in hybrid). However, the"}

However, the phase-out of several purchase subsidies in Germany slowed overall EV sales growth. At the start of 2023, PHEV subsidies were phased out, resulting in lower PHEV sales compared to 2022, and in December 2023, all EV subsidies ended after a ruling on the Climate and Transformation Fund. In Germany, the sales share for electric cars fell from 30% in 2022 to 25% in 2023. This had an impact on the overall electric car sales share in the region. In the rest of Europe, however, electric car sales and their sales share increased. Around 25% of all cars sold in France and the United Kingdom were electric, 30% in the Netherlands, and 60% in Sweden. In Norway, sales shares increased slightly despite the overall market contracting, and its sales share remains the highest in Europe, at almost 95%. 4 Based on model trim eligibility from the US government website as of 31 March 2024.

CC BY 4.0. For the first time, China was the front-runner in fuel cell electric vehicle deployment in 2023 In 2023, the global stock of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) increased by around 20% compared to 2022, reaching 87 600 by the end of the year. Of the 15 400 new FCEVs hitting the roads in 2023, about half were cars, around one-quarter were medium- and heavy-duty trucks, and almost 10% were buses. The fastest-growing segment was light commercial vehicles, for which the stock approximately tripled in 2023, mainly thanks to sales in China. The stock of heavy-duty fuel cell trucks doubled. At the end of 2023, Asia accounted for over 70% of FCEVs worldwide, followed by North America with 20% and Europe with less than 10%. Korea is the leading country in terms of FCEV stock, accounting for almost 40% of all FCEVs, mainly due to its large passenger car fleet (exceeding 33 000). The United States is home to 18 200 FCEVs, almost all of which are fuel cell cars. The United States has the second-largest fuel cell car stock worldwide, with around 30% of the global stock. However, in 2023, China became home to the second-largest FCEV fleet, overtaking the United States, and constituting over 20% of the total FCEV stock. Despite having fewer than 800 fuel cell cars, China has the largest fleet across all other segments. It accounts for around 95% of medium- and heavy-duty fuel cell trucks, 90% of fuel cell LCVs, and just over 80% of fuel cell buses.

Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in electric cars PAGE | 22 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Sales in emerging markets are increasing, albeit from a low base, led by Southeast Asia and Brazil Electric car sales continued to increase in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) outside China in 2023, but they remained low overall. In many cases, personal cars are not the most common means of passenger transport, especially compared with shared vans and minibuses, or two- and threewheelers (2/3Ws), which are more prevalent and more often electrified, given their relative accessibility and affordability. The electrification of 2/3Ws and public or shared mobility will be key to achieve emissions reductions in such cases (see later sections in this report). While switching from internal combustion engine (ICE) to electric cars is important, the effect on overall emissions differs depending on the mode of transport that is displaced. Replacing 2/3Ws, public and shared mobility or more active forms of transport with personal cars may not be desirable in all cases. In India, electric car registrations were up 70% year-on-year to 80 000, compared to a growth rate of under 10% for total car sales. Around 2% of all cars sold were electric. Purchase incentives under the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME II) scheme, supply-side incentives under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, tax benefits and the Go Electric campaign have all contributed to fostering demand in recent years. A number of new models also became popular in 2023, such as Mahindra’s XUV400, MG’s Comet, Citroën’s eC3, BYD’s Yuan Plus, and Hyundai’s Ioniq 5, driving up growth compared to 2022. However, if the forthcoming FAME III scheme includes a subsidy reduction, as has been speculated in line with lower subsidy levels in the 2024 budget, future growth could be affected. Local carmakers have thus far maintained a strong foothold in the market, supported by advantageous import tariffs, and account for 80% of electric car sales in cumulative terms since 2010, led by Tata (70%) and Mahindra (10%). In Thailand, electric car registrations more than quadrupled year-on-year to nearly 90 000, reaching a notable 10% sales share – comparable to the share in the United States. This is all the more impressive given that overall car sales in the country decreased from 2022 to 2023. New subsidies, including for domestic battery manufacturing, and lower import and excise taxes, combined with the growing presence of Chinese carmakers, have contributed to rapidly increasing sales. Chinese companies account for over half the sales to date, and they could become even more prominent given that BYD plans to start operating EV production facilities in Thailand in 2024, with an annual production capacity of 150 000 vehicles for an investment of just under USD 500 million. Thailand aims to become a major EV manufacturing hub for domestic and export markets, and is aiming to attract USD 28 billion in foreign investment within 4 years, backed by specific incentives to foster investment.

Domestic front-runner VinFast, established in 2017, accounted for nearly all domestic sales. VinFast also started selling electric sports utility vehicles (SUVs) in North America in 2023, as well as developing manufacturing facilities in order to unlock domestic content-linked subsidies under the US IRA. VinFast is investing around USD 2 billion and targets an annual production of 150 000 vehicles in the United States by 2025. The company went public in 2023, far exceeding expectations with a debut market valuation of around USD 85 billion, well beyond General Motors (GM) (USD 46 billion), Ford (USD 48 billion) or BMW (USD 68 billion), before it settled back down around USD 20 billion by the end of the year. VinFast also looks to enter regional markets, such as India and the Philippines. In Malaysia, electric car registrations more than tripled to 10 000, supported by tax breaks and import duty exemptions, as well as an acceleration in charging infrastructure roll-out. In 2023, Mercedes-Benz marketed the first domestically assembled EV, and both BYD and Tesla also entered the market. In Latin America, electric car sales reached almost 90 000 in 2023, with markets in Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica and Mexico leading the region. In Brazil, electric car registrations nearly tripled year-on-year to more than 50 000, a market share of 3%. Growth in Brazil was underpinned by the entry of Chinese carmakers, such as BYD with its Song and Dolphin models, Great Wall with its H6, and Chery with its Tiggo 8, which immediately ranked among the best-selling models in 2023. Road transport electrification in Brazil could bring significant climate benefits given the largely low-emissions power mix, as well as reducing local air pollution. However, EV adoption has been slow thus far, given the national prioritisation of ethanol-based fuels since the late 1970s as a strategy to maintain energy security in the face of oil shocks. Today, biofuels are important alternative fuels available at competitive cost and aligned with the existing refuelling infrastructure. Brazil remains the world’s largest producer of sugar cane, and its agribusiness represents about one-fourth of GDP. At the end of 2023, Brazil launched the Green Mobility and Innovation Programme, which provides tax incentives for companies to develop and manufacture low-emissions road transport technology, aggregating to more than BRA 19 billion (Brazilian reals) (USD 3.8 billion) over the 2024-2028 period. Several major carmakers already in Brazil are developing hybrid ethanol-electric models as a result. China’s BYD and Great Wall are also planning to start domestic manufacturing, counting on local battery metal deposits, and plan to sell both fully electric and hybrid ethanol-electric models. BYD is investing over USD 600 million in its electric car plant in Brazil – its first outside Asia – for an annual capacity of 150 000 vehicles. BYD also partnered with Raízen to develop charging infrastructure in eight Brazilian cities starting in 2024. GM, on Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in electric cars PAGE | 25 IEA. CC BY 4.0. the other hand, plans to stop producing ICE (including ethanol) models and go fully electric, notably to produce for export markets. In 2024, Hyundai announced investments of USD 1.1 billion to 2032 to start local manufacturing of electric, hybrid and hydrogen cars. In Mexico, electric car registrations were up 80% year-on-year to 15 000, a market share just above 1%. Given its proximity to the United States, Mexico’s automotive market is already well integrated with North American partners, and benefits from advantageous trade agreements, large existing manufacturing capacity, and eligibility for subsidies under the IRA. As a result, local EV supply chains are developing quickly, with expectations that this will spill over into domestic markets. Tesla, Ford, Stellantis, BMW, GM, Volkswagen (VW) and Audi have all either started manufacturing or announced plans to manufacture EVs in Mexico. Chinese carmakers such as BYD, Chery and SAIC are also considering expanding to Mexico. Elsewhere in the region, Colombia and Costa Rica are seeing increasing electric car sales, with around 6 000 and 5 000 in 2023, respectively, but sales remain limited in other Central and South American countries. Throughout Africa, Eurasia"}

Throughout Africa, Eurasia and the Middle East, electric cars are still rare, accounting for less than 1% of total car sales. However, as Chinese carmakers look for opportunities abroad, new models – including those produced domestically – could boost EV sales. For example, in Uzbekistan, BYD set up a joint venture with UzAuto Motors in 2023 to produce 50 000 electric cars annually, and Chery International established a partnership with ADM Jizzakh. This partnership has already led to a steep increase in electric car sales in Uzbekistan, reaching around 10 000 in 2023. In the Middle East, Jordan boasts the highest electric car sales share, at more than 45%, supported by much lower import duties relative to ICE cars, followed by the United Arab Emirates, with 13%. Policy support in Indonesia is attracting international majors and boosting electric car sales Until 2019, annual electric car sales in Indonesia were below 100, increasing tenfold to under 1 000 in 2020-2021. In 2022, annual sales jumped to over 10 000, and in 2023 they reached 17 000, supported by purchase incentives. Electric cars benefit from a reduced Value-Added Tax of 1% (compared to 11% for conventional cars), are exempt from the luxury tax that applies to many vehicles, and from import tax, and are eligible for regional tax reductions. Increasing model availability is also helping boost sales. As in many other countries in the region, foreign carmakers – especially Chinese – are increasingly entering the market. Chinese companies accounted for 75% of electric car sales in 2022, and 45% in 2023. For example, Wuling’s Air EV, which is competitively Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in electric cars PAGE | 26 IEA. CC BY 4.0. priced relative to conventional cars, at around IDR 220 million (Indonesian rupiah) (USD 14 000), has become a best-seller. Other best-selling models, such as Toyota’s Kijang at IDR 420 million (USD 25 000) or Hyundai’s Ioniq at IDR 670 million (USD 42 000), remain more expensive than conventional equivalents, appealing to a pool of wealthier early adopters. In 2023, in order to promote domestic manufacturing, the government of Indonesia limited purchase incentives to models meeting local content requirements of 40%. As of 2023, only two models (Hyundai’s Ioniq and Wuling’s Air) met this criteria, which, alongside rising interest rates for credit-backed car purchases, may have hampered growth. In 2023, sales fell short of the government’s target of subsidising 36 000 electric cars, and at the end of the year, local content requirements were relaxed until 2026. As a result, international companies are now setting up manufacturing facilities in the country, such as BYD and VinFast, both expected in 2024. Available BYD models will be priced at IDR 400 million (USD 25 000), and VinFast at IDR 250 million (USD 16 000). BYD plans to invest USD 1.3 billion in manufacturing facilities with an annual capacity of 150 000 cars, and VinFast to assemble 50 000 cars a year. Electric buses and 2/3Ws have not yet experienced the same success. In 2023, Indonesia’s 100 electric buses were primarily concentrated in Jakarta, and imported from China; the provincial government aims to add another 200 in 2024. Electric 2/3W sales reached about 11 500 in 2023, well below the government target to subsidise 200 000. Factors limiting 2/3W uptake include low ranges and lack of charging points to enable interurban journeys. Looking forward, Indonesia aims to have 2 million electric cars and 13 million electric 2/3Ws on the road by 2030. The new capital city will mandate EVs as the main means of transportation. Battery manufacturing capacity is also ramping up, capitalising on rich nickel reserves. In 2024, Indonesia announced a joint venture between Hyundai, LG Energy Solution, and Indonesia Battery Corporation, as part of a IDR 140 trillion (USD 9.8 billion) public support package. Strong electric car sales in the first quarter of 2024 surpass the annual total from just four years ago Electric car sales remained strong in the first quarter of 2024, surpassing those of the same period in 2023 by around 25% to reach more than 3 million.

This growth rate was similar to the increase observed for the same period in 2023 compared to 2022. The majority of the additional sales came from China, which sold about half a million more electric cars than over the same period in 2023. In relative terms, the most substantial growth was observed outside of the major EV markets, where sales increased by over 50%, suggesting that the transition to electromobility is picking up in an increasing number of countries worldwide. Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in electric cars PAGE | 27 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Quarterly electric car sales, 2021-2024 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Source: IEA analysis based on data from on EV Volumes, China Passenger Car Association and the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association. From January to March of this year, nearly 1.9 million electric cars were sold in China, marking an almost 35% increase compared to sales in the first quarter of 2023. In March, NEV sales in China surpassed a share of 40% in overall car sales for the first time, according to retail sales reported by the China Passenger Car Association. As witnessed in 2023, sales of plug-in hybrid electric cars are growing faster than sales of pure battery electric cars. Plug-in hybrid electric car sales in the first quarter increased by around 75% year-on-year in China, compared to just 15% for battery electric car sales, though the former started from a lower base. In Europe, the first quarter of 2024 saw year-on-year growth of over 5%, slightly above the growth in overall car sales and thereby stabilising the EV sales share at a similar level as last year. Electric car sales growth was particularly high in Belgium, where around 60 000 electric cars were sold, almost 35% more than the year before. However, Belgium represents less than 5% of total European car sales. In the major European markets – France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom (together representing about 60% of European car sales) – growth in electric car sales was lower. In France, overall EV sales in the first quarter grew by about 15%, with BEV sales growth being higher than for PHEVs. While this is less than half the rate as over the same period last year, total sales were nonetheless higher and led to a slight increase in the share of EVs in total car sales. The United Kingdom saw similar year-on-year growth (over 15%) in EV sales as France, about the same rate as over the same period last year. In Germany, where battery electric car subsidies ended in 2023, sales of electric cars fell by almost 5% in the first quarter of 2024, mainly as a result of a 20% year-onyear decrease in March. The share of EVs in total car sales was therefore slightly lower than last year. As in China, PHEV sales in both Germany and the United Kingdom were stronger than BEV sales. In Italy, sales of electric cars in 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 2022 2024 Million Rest of world United States Europe China Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in electric cars PAGE | 28 IEA.

However, this trend could be reversed based on the introduction of a new incentive scheme, and if Chinese automaker Chery succeeds in appealing to Italian consumers when it enters the market later this year. In the United States, first-quarter sales reached around 350 000, almost 15% higher than over the same period the year before. As in other major markets, the sales growth of PHEVs was even higher, at 50%. While the BEV sales share in the United States appears to have fallen somewhat over the past few months, the sales share of PHEVs has grown. In smaller EV markets, sales growth in the first months of 2024 was much higher, albeit from a low base. In January and February, electric car sales almost quadrupled in Brazil and increased more than sevenfold in Viet Nam. In India, sales increased more than 50% in the first quarter of 2024.

In January and February, electric car sales almost quadrupled in Brazil and increased more than sevenfold in Viet Nam. In India, sales increased more than 50% in the first quarter of 2024. These figures suggest that EVs are gaining momentum across diverse markets worldwide. Since 2021, first-quarter electric car sales have typically accounted for 15-20% of the total global annual sales. Based on this observed trend, coupled with policy momentum and the seasonality that EV sales typically experience, we estimate that electric car sales could reach around 17 million in 2024. This indicates robust growth for a maturing market, with 2024 sales to surpass those of 2023 by more than 20% and EVs to reach a share in total car sales of more than one-fifth. Electric car sales, 2010-2024 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Note: 2024 sales (“2024E”) are estimated based on market trends through the first quarter of 2024.

CC BY 4.0. The majority of the additional 3 million electric car sales projected for 2024 relative to 2023 are from China. Despite the phase-out of NEV purchase subsidies last year, sales in China have remained robust, indicating that the market is maturing. With strong competition and relatively low-cost electric cars, sales are to grow by almost 25% in 2024 compared to last year, reaching around 10 million. If confirmed, this figure will come close to the total global electric car sales in 2022. As a result, electric car sales could represent around 45% of total car sales in China over 2024. In 2024, electric car sales in the United States are projected to rise by 20% compared to the previous year, translating to almost half a million more sales, relative to 2023. Despite reporting of a rocky end to 2023 for electric cars in the United States, sales shares are projected to remain robust in 2024. Over the entire year, around one in nine cars sold are expected to be electric. Based on recent trends, and considering that tightening CO2 targets are due to come in only in 2025, the growth in electric car sales in Europe is expected to be the lowest of the three largest markets. Sales are projected to reach around 3.5 million units in 2024, reflecting modest growth of less than 10% compared to the previous year. In the context of a generally weak outlook for passenger car sales, electric cars would still represent about one in four cars sold in Europe. Outside of the major EV markets, electric car sales are anticipated to reach the milestone of over 1 million units in 2024, marking a significant increase of over 40% compared to 2023. Recent trends showing the success of both homegrown and Chinese electric carmakers in Southeast Asia underscore that the region is set to make a strong contribution to the sales of emerging EV markets (see the section on Trends in the electric vehicle industry). Despite some uncertainty surrounding whether India’s forthcoming FAME III scheme will include subsidies for electric cars, we expect sales in India to remain robust, and to experience around 50% growth compared to 2023. Across all regions outside the three major EV markets, electric car sales are expected to represent around 5% of total car sales in 2024, which – considering the high growth rates seen in recent years – could indicate that a tipping point towards global mass adoption is getting closer. There are of course downside risks to the 2024 outlook for electric car sales. Factors such as high interest rates and economic uncertainty could potentially reduce the growth of global electric car sales in 2024. Other challenges may come from the IRA restrictions on US electric car tax incentives, and the tightening of technical requirements for EVs to qualify for the purchase tax exemption in China. However, there are also upside potentials to consider. New markets may open up more rapidly than anticipated, as automakers expand their EV operations and new entrants compete for market share. This could lead to accelerated growth in electric car sales globally, surpassing the initial estimations. Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in electric cars PAGE | 30 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Electric car"}

Electric car availability and affordability More electric models are becoming available, but the trend is towards larger ones The number of available electric car models nears 600, twothirds of which are large vehicles and SUVs In 2023, the number of available models for electric cars increased 15% year-onyear to nearly 590, as carmakers scaled up electrification plans, seeking to appeal to a growing consumer base. Meanwhile, the number of fully ICE models (i.e. excluding hybrids) declined for the fourth consecutive year, at an average of 2%. Based on recent original equipment manufacturer (OEM) announcements, the number of new electric car models could reach 1 000 by 2028. If all announced new electric models actually reach the market, and if the number of available ICE car models continues to decline by 2% annually, there could be as many electric as ICE car models before 2030.

CC BY 4.0. As reported in GEVO-2023, the share of small and medium electric car models is decreasing among available electric models: in 2023, two-thirds of the batteryelectric models on the market were SUVs,5 pick-up trucks or large cars. Just 25% of battery electric car sales in the United States were for small and medium models, compared to 40% in Europe and 50% in China. Electric cars are following the same trend as conventional cars, and getting bigger on average. In 2023, SUVs, pick-up trucks and large models accounted for 65% of total ICE car sales worldwide, and more than 80% in the United States, 60% in China and 50% in Europe. Several factors underpin the increase in the share of large models. Since the 2010s, conventional SUVs in the United States have benefited from less stringent tailpipe emissions rules than smaller models, creating an incentive for carmakers to market more vehicles in that segment. Similarly, in the European Union, CO2 targets for passenger cars have included a compromise on weight, allowing CO2 leeway for heavier vehicles in some cases. Larger vehicles also mean larger margins for carmakers. Given that incumbent carmakers are not yet making a profit on their EV offer in many cases, focusing on larger models enables them to increase their margins. Under the US IRA, electric SUVs can qualify for tax credits as long as they are priced under USD 80 000, whereas the limit stands at USD 55 000 for a sedan, creating an incentive to market SUVs if a greater margin can be gathered. On the demand side, there is now strong willingness to pay for SUVs or large models. Consumers are typically interested in longer-range and larger cars for their primary vehicles, even though small models are more suited to urban use.

Higher marketing spend on SUVs compared to smaller models can also have an impact on consumer choices. The progressive shift towards ICE SUVs has been dramatically limiting fuel savings. Over the 2010-2022 period, without the shift to SUVs, energy use per kilometre could have fallen at an average annual rate 30% higher than the actual rate. Switching to electric in the SUV and larger car segments can therefore achieve immediate and significant CO2 emissions reductions, and electrification also brings considerable benefits in terms of reducing air pollution and non-tailpipe emissions, especially in urban settings. In 2023, if all ICE and HEV sales of SUVs had instead been BEV, around 770 Mt CO2 could have been avoided globally over the cars’ lifetimes (see section 10 on lifecycle analysis). This is equivalent to the total road emissions of China in 2023. 5 SUVs may be defined differently across regions, but broadly refer to vehicles that incorporate features commonly found in off-road vehicles (e.g. four-wheel drive, higher ground clearance, larger cargo area). In this report, small and large SUVs both count as SUVs. Crossovers are counted as SUVs if they feature an SUV body type; otherwise they are categorised as medium-sized vehicles.

Nevertheless, from a policy perspective, it is critical to mitigate the negative spillovers associated with an increase in larger electric cars in the fleet. Larger electric car models have a significant impact on battery supply chains and critical mineral demand. In 2023, the sales-weighted average battery electric SUV in Europe had a battery almost twice as large as the one in the average small electric car, with a proportionate impact on critical mineral needs. Of course, the range of small cars is typically shorter than SUVs and large cars (see later section on ranges). However, when comparing electric SUVs and medium-sized electric cars, which in 2023 offered a similar range, the SUV battery was still 25% larger. This means that if all electric SUVs sold in 2023 had instead been medium-sized cars, around 60 GWh of battery equivalent could have been avoided globally, with limited impact on range. Accounting for the different chemistries used in China, Europe, and the United States, this would be equivalent to almost 6 000 tonnes of lithium, 30 000 tonnes of nickel, almost 7 000 tonnes of cobalt, and over 8 000 tonnes of manganese. Larger manganese also require more power, or longer charging times. This can put pressure on electricity grids and charging infrastructure by increasing occupancy, which could create issues during peak utilisation, such as at highway charging points at high traffic times. In addition, larger vehicles also require greater quantities of materials such as iron and steel, aluminium and plastics, with a higher environmental and carbon footprint for materials production, processing and assembly. Because they are heavier, larger models also have higher electricity consumption.

In Norway, for example, all cars are subject to a purchase tax based on weight, CO2 and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions, though electric cars were exempt from the weight-based tax prior to 2023. Any imported cars weighing more than 500 kg must also pay an entry fee for each additional kg. In France, a progressive weight-based tax applies to ICE and PHEV cars weighing above 1 600 kg, with a significant impact on price: weight tax for a Land Rover Defender 130 (2 550 kg) adds up to more than EUR 21 500, versus zero for a Renault Clio (1 100 kg).

In February 2024, a referendum held in Paris resulted in a tripling of city parking fees for visiting SUVs, applicable to ICE, hybrid and plug-in hybrid cars above 1 600 kg and battery electric ones above 2 000 kg, in an effort to limit the use of large and/or polluting vehicles. Other examples exist in Estonia, Finland, Switzerland and the Netherlands. A number of policy options may be used, such as caps and fleet averages for vehicle footprint, weight, and/or battery size; access to finance for smaller vehicles; and sustained support for public charging, enabling wider use of shorter-range cars. Average range is increasing, but only moderately Concerns about range compared to ICE vehicles, and about the availability of charging infrastructure for long-distance journeys, also contribute to increasing appetite for larger models with longer range.

This is encouraging for consumers looking to purchase an electric car for longer journeys rather than urban use. Since 2020, growth in the average range of vehicles has been slower than over the 2015-2020 period. This could result from a number of factors, including fluctuating battery prices, carmakers’ attempts to limit additional costs as competition intensifies, and technical constraints (e.g. energy density, battery size). It could also reflect that beyond a certain range at which most driving needs are met, consumers’ willingness to pay for a marginal increase in battery size and range is limited. Looking forward, however, the average range could start increasing again as novel battery technologies mature and prices fall. More affordable electric cars are needed to reach a mass-market tipping point An equitable and inclusive transition to electric mobility, both within countries and at the global level, hinges on the successful launch of affordable EVs (including but not limited to electric cars). In this section, we use historic sales and price data for electric and ICE models around the world to examine the total cost of owning an electric car, price trends over time, and the remaining electric premium, by country and vehicle size.7 Specific models are used for illustration. Total cost of ownership Car purchase decisions typically involve consideration of retail price and available subsidies as well as lifetime operating costs, such as fuel costs, insurance, maintenance and depreciation, which together make up the total cost of ownership (TCO). Reaching TCO parity between electric and ICE cars creates important financial incentives to make the switch. This section examines the different components of the TCO, by region and car size. In 2023, upfront retail prices for electric cars were generally higher than for their ICE equivalents, which increased their TCO in relative terms. On the upside, higher fuel efficiency and lower maintenance costs enable fuel cost savings for electric cars, lowering their TCO. This is especially true in periods when fuel prices are high, in places where electricity prices are not too closely correlated to fossil 7 Price data points collected from various data providers and ad-hoc sources cover 65-95% of both electric and ICE car sales globally. By “price”, we refer to the advertised price that the customer pays for the acquisition of the vehicle only, including legally required acquisition taxes (e.g. including Value-Added Tax and registration taxes but excluding consumer tax credits). Prices reflect not only the materials, components and manufacturing costs, but also the costs related to sales and marketing, administration, R&D and the profit margin. In the case of a small electric car in Europe, for example, these mark-up costs can account for around 40% of the final pre-tax price. They account for an even greater share of the final pre-tax price when consumers purchase additional options, or opt for larger models, for which margins can be higher. The price for the same model may differ across countries or regions (e.g. in 2023, a VW ID.3 could be purchased in China at half its price in Europe). Throughout the whole section, prices are adjusted for inflation and expressed in constant 2022 USD. Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in electric cars PAGE | 36 IEA. CC BY 4.0. fuel prices. Depreciation is also a major factor in determining TCO: As a car ages, it loses value, and depreciation for electric cars tends to be faster than for ICE equivalents, further increasing their TCO. Accelerated depreciation could, however, prove beneficial for the development of second-hand markets. However, the trend towards faster depreciation for electric vehicles might be reversed for multiple reasons. Firstly, consumers are gaining more confidence in electric battery lifetimes, thereby increasing the resale value of EVs. Secondly, strong demand and the positive brand image of some BEV models can mean they hold their value longer, as shown by Tesla models depreciating more slowly than the average petrol car in the United States. Finally, increasing fuel prices in some regions, the roll-out of low-emissions zones that restrict access for the most polluting vehicles, and taxes and parking fees specifically"}

Finally, increasing fuel prices in some regions, the roll-out of low-emissions zones that restrict access for the most polluting vehicles, and taxes and parking fees specifically targeted at ICE vehicles could mean they experience faster depreciation rates than EVs in the future. In light of these two possible opposing depreciation trends, the same fixed annual depreciation rate for both BEVs and ICE vehicles has been applied in the following cost of ownership analysis. Subsidies help lower the TCO of electric cars relative to ICE equivalents in multiple ways. A purchase subsidy lowers the original retail price, thereby lowering capital depreciation over time, and a lower retail price implies lower financing costs through cumulative interest. Subsidies can significantly reduce the number of years required to reach TCO parity between electric and ICE equivalents. As of 2022, we estimate that TCO parity could be reached in most cases in under 7 years in the three major EV markets, with significant variations across different car sizes. In comparison, for models purchased at 2018 prices, TCO parity was much harder to achieve. Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in electric cars PAGE | 37 IEA. CC BY 4.0.

CC BY 4.0. In Germany, for example, we estimate that the sales-weighted average price of a medium-sized battery electric car in 2022 was 10-20% more expensive than its ICE equivalent, but 10-20% cheaper in cumulative costs of ownership after 5 years, thanks to fuel and maintenance costs savings. In the case of an electric SUV, we estimate that the average annual operating cost savings would amount to USD 1 800 when compared to the equivalent conventional SUV over a period of 10 years. In the United States, despite lower fuel prices with respect to electricity, the higher average annual mileage results in savings that are close to Germany at USD 1 600 per year. In China, lower annual distance driven reduces fuel cost savings potential, but the very low price of electricity enables savings of about USD 1 000 per year. These figures provide an indication of how long it would take to recoup the initial purchase price gap between a BEV and its equivalent ICEV through operating cost savings. In EMDEs, some electric cars can also be cheaper than ICE equivalents over their lifetime. This is true in India, for example, although it depends on the financing instrument.

CC BY 4.0. Upfront retail price parity Achieving price parity between electric and ICE cars will be an important tipping point. Even when the TCO for electric cars is advantageous, the upfront retail price plays a decisive role, and mass-market consumers are typically more sensitive to price premiums than wealthier buyers. This holds true not only in emerging and developing economies, which have comparatively high costs of capital and comparatively low household and business incomes, but also in advanced economies. In the United States, for example, surveys suggest affordability was the top concern for consumers considering EV adoption in 2023. Other estimates show that even among SUV and pick-up truck consumers, only 50% would be willing to purchase one above USD 50 000. In this section, we examine historic price trends for electric and ICE cars over the 2018-2022 period, by country and car size, and for best-selling models in 2023. Electric cars are generally getting cheaper as battery prices drop, competition intensifies, and carmakers achieve economies of scale. In most cases, however, they remain on average more expensive than ICE equivalents. In some cases, after adjusting for inflation, their price stagnated or even moderately increased between 2018 and 2022. Larger batteries for longer ranges increase car prices, and so too do the additional options, equipment, digital technology and luxury features that are often marketed on top of the base model. A disproportionate focus on larger, premium models is pushing up the average price, which – added to the lack of available models in second-hand markets (see below) – limits potential to reach mass-market consumers. Importantly, geopolitical tension, trade and supply chain disruptions, increasing battery prices in 2022 relative to 2021, and rising inflation, have also significantly affected the potential for further cost declines. Competition can also play an important role in bringing down electric car prices. Intensifying competition leads carmakers to cut prices to the minimum profit margin they can sustain, and – if needed – to do so more quickly than battery and production costs decline. For example, between mid-2022 and early-2024, Tesla cut the price of its Model Y from between USD 65 000 and USD 70 000 to between USD 45 000 and USD 55 000 in the United States. Battery prices for such a model dropped by only USD 3 000 over the same period in the United States, suggesting that a profit margin may still be made at a lower price. Similarly, in China, the price of the Base Model Y dropped from CNY 320 000 (Yuan renminbi) (USD 47 000) to CNY 250 000 (USD 38 000), while the corresponding battery price fell by only USD 1 000. Conversely, in cases where electric models remain niche or aimed at wealthier, less price-sensitive early adopters, their price may not fall as quickly as battery prices, if carmakers can sustain greater margins.

China In China, where the sales share of electric cars has been high for several years, the sales-weighted average price of electric cars (before purchase subsidy) is already lower than that of ICE cars. This is true not only when looking at total sales, but also at the small cars segment, and is close for SUVs. After accounting for the EV exemption from the 10% vehicle purchase tax, electric SUVs were already on par with conventional ones in 2022, on average. Electric car prices have dropped significantly since 2018. We estimate that around 55% of the electric cars sold in China in 2022 were cheaper than their average ICE equivalent, up from under 10% in 2018. Given the further price declines between 2022 and 2023, we estimate that this share increased to around 65% in 2023. These encouraging trends suggest that price parity between electric and ICE cars could also be reached in other countries in certain segments by 2030, if the sales share of electric cars continues to grow, and if supporting infrastructure – such as for charging – is sustained. -50% 0% 50% 100% 150% 200% 2022 2022 2022 2022 Small Medium SUV All segments Electric premium (%) China France Germany United Kingdom United States Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in electric cars PAGE | 41 IEA.

This is in the same range as best-selling small ICE cars in 2023, which cost from CNY 70 000 to CNY 100 000. In 2022, the bestselling electric car was SAIC’s small Wuling Hongguang Mini EV, which accounted for 10% of all BEV sales. It was priced around CNY 40 000, weighing under 700 kg for a 170-km range. In 2023, however, it was overtaken by Tesla models, among other larger models, as new consumers seek longer ranges and higher-end options and digital equipment.

The price of each battery electric vehicle sale is compared to the sales-weighted average price of all internal combustion engine (conventional) vehicles within the same segment. Price data excludes any vehicle purchase tax exemption or vehicle purchase subsidy. Sources: IEA analysis based on data from IHS Markit. United States In the United States, the sales-weighted average price of electric cars decreased over the 2018-2022 period, primarily driven by a considerable drop in the price of Tesla cars, which account for a significant share of sales. The sales-weighted average retail price of electric SUVs fell slightly more quickly than the average SUV battery costs over the same period. The average price of small and medium models also decreased, albeit to a smaller extent. Across all segments, electric models remained more expensive than conventional equivalents in 2022. However, the gap has since begun to close, as market size increases and competition leads carmakers to cut prices.

Average price parity between electric and conventional SUVs could be reached by 2030, but it may only be reached later for small and medium cars, given their lower availability and popularity. Smaller, cheaper electric models have further to go to reach price parity in the United States. We estimate that in 2022, only about 5% of the electric cars sold in the United States were cheaper than their average ICE equivalent. In 2023, the cheapest electric cars were priced around USD 30 000 (e.g. Chevrolet Bolt, Nissan Leaf, Mini Cooper SE). To compare, best-selling small ICE options cost under USD 20 000 (e.g. Kia Rio, Mitsubishi Mirage), and many best-selling medium ICE options between USD 20 000 and USD 25 000 (e.g. Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, Kia Forte, Hyundai Avante, Nissan Sentra). Around 25 new all-electric car models are expected in 2024, but only 5 of them are expected below USD 50 000, and none under the USD 30 000 mark. Considering all the electric models expected to be available in 2024, about 75% are priced above USD 50 000, and fewer than 10 under USD 40 000, even after taking into account the USD 7 500 tax credit under the IRA for eligible cars as of February 2024. This means that despite the tax credit, few electric car models directly compete with small mass-market ICE models.

CC BY 4.0. In December 2023, GM stopped production of its best-selling electric car, the Bolt, announcing it would introduce a new version in 2025. The Nissan Leaf (40 kWh) therefore remains the cheapest available electric car in 2024, at just under USD 30 000, but is not yet eligible for IRA tax credits. Ford announced in 2024 that it would move away from large and expensive electric cars as a way to convince more consumers to switch to electric, at the same time as increasing output of ICE models to help finance a transition to electric mobility. In 2024, Tesla announced it would start producing a next-generation, compact and affordable electric car in June 2025, but the company had already announced in 2020 that it would deliver a USD 25 000 model within 3 years. Some micro urban electric cars are already available between USD 5 000 and USD 20 000 (e.g. Arcimoto FUV, Nimbus One), but they are rare. In theory, such models could cover many use cases, since 80% of car journeys in the United States are under 10 miles. Europe Pricing trends differ across European countries, and typically vary by segment. In Norway, after taking into account the EV sales tax exemption, electric cars are already cheaper than ICE equivalents across all segments. In 2022, we estimate that the electric premium stood around -15%, and even -30% for medium-sized cars. Five years earlier, in 2018, the overall electric premium was less advantageous, at around -5%. The progressive reintroduction of sales taxes on electric cars may change these estimates for 2023 onwards. Germany’s electric premium ranks among the lowest in the European Union. Although the sales-weighted average electric premium increased slightly between 2018 and 2022, it stood at 15% in 2022. It is particularly low for medium-sized cars (10-15%) and SUVs (20%), but remains higher than 50% for small models. In the case of medium cars, the sales-weighted average electric premium was as low as EUR 5 000 in 2022. We estimate that in 2022, over 40% of the medium electric cars sold in Germany were cheaper than their average ICE equivalent. Looking at total sales, over 25% of the electric cars sold in 2022 were cheaper than their average ICE equivalent. In 2023, the cheapest models among the best-selling medium electric cars were priced between EUR 22 000 and EUR 35 000 (e.g. MG MG4, Dacia Spring, Renault Megane), far cheaper than the three front-runners priced above EUR 45 000 (VW ID.3, Cupra Born, and Tesla Model 3).

In France, the sales-weighted average electric premium stagnated between 2018 and 2022. The average price of ICE cars also increased over the same period, though more moderately than that of electric models. Despite a drop in the price of electric SUVs, which stood at a 30% premium over ICE equivalents in 2022, the former do not account for a high enough share of total electric car sales to drive down the overall average. The electric premium for small and medium cars remains around 40-50%. These trends mirror those of some of the best-selling models. For example, when adjusting prices for inflation, the small Renault Zoe was sold at the same price on average in 2022-2023 as in 2018-2019, or EUR 30 000 (USD 32 000). It could be found for sale at as low as EUR 25 000 in 2015-2016. The earlier models, in 2015, had a battery size of around 20 kWh, which increased to around 40 kWh in 2018-2019 and 50 kWh in newer models in 2022-2023. Yet European battery prices fell more quickly than the battery size increased over the same period, indicating that battery size alone does not explain car price dynamics. In 2023, the cheapest electric cars in France were priced between EUR 22 000 and EUR 30 000 (e.g. Dacia Spring, Renault Twingo E-Tech, Smart EQ Fortwo), while best-selling small ICE models were available between EUR 10 000 and EUR 20 000 (e.g. Renault Clio, Peugeot 208, Citroën C3, Dacia Sandero, Opel 0% 50% 100% 150% 200% Small Medium Small Medium Small Medium China Europe United States Median household affordability (%) BEV (cheapest) ICEV (cheapest) BEV (best-selling) ICEV (best-selling) 0% 25% 50% 75% 100% SUV SUV SUV China Europe USA Top 10% household affordability (%) Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in electric cars PAGE | 45 IEA.

Since mid-2024, subsidies of up to EUR 4 000 can be granted for electric cars priced under EUR 47 000, with an additional subsidy of up to EUR 3 000 for lower-income households. In the United Kingdom, the sales-weighted average electric premium shrank between 2018 and 2022, thanks to a drop in prices for electric SUVs, as in the United States. Nonetheless, electric SUVs still stood at a 45% premium over ICE equivalents in 2022, which is similar to the premium for small models but far higher than for medium cars (20%). In 2023, the cheapest electric cars in the United Kingdom were priced from GBP 27 000 to GBP 30 000 (USD 33 000 to 37 000) (e.g. MG MG4, Fiat 500, Nissan Leaf, Renault Zoe), with the exception of the"}

To compare, best-selling small ICE options could be found from GBP 10 000 to 17 000 (e.g. Peugeot 208, Fiat 500, Dacia Sandero) and medium options below GBP 25 000 (e.g. Ford Puma). Since July 2022, there has been no subsidy for the purchase of electric passenger cars. Elsewhere in Europe, electric cars remain typically much more expensive than ICE equivalents. In Poland, for example, just a few electric car models could be found at prices competitive with ICE cars in 2023, under the PLN 150 000 (Polish zloty) (EUR 35 000) mark. Over 70% of electric car sales in 2023 were for SUVs, or large or more luxurious models, compared to less than 60% for ICE cars. In 2023, there were several announcements by European OEMs for smaller models priced under EUR 25 000 in the near-term (e.g. Renault R5, Citroën e-C3, Fiat e-Panda, VW ID.2all). There is also some appetite for urban microcars (i.e. L6-L7 category), learning from the success of China’s Wuling. Miniature models bring important benefits if they displace conventional models, helping reduce battery and critical mineral demand. Their prices are often below USD 5 000 (e.g. Microlino, Fiat Topolino, Citroën Ami, Silence S04, Birò B2211). In Europe and the United States, electric car prices are expected to come down as a result of falling battery prices, more efficient manufacturing, and competition. Independent analyses suggest that price parity between some electric and ICE car models in certain segments could be reached over the 2025-2028 period, for example for small electric cars in Europe in 2025 or soon after. However, many market variables could delay price parity, such as volatile commodity prices, supply chain bottlenecks, and the ability of carmakers to yield sufficient margins from cheaper electric models. The typical rule in which economies of scale bring down costs is being complicated by numerous other market forces. These include a dynamic regulatory context, geopolitical competition, domestic content incentives, and a continually evolving technology landscape, with competing battery chemistries that each have their own economies of scale and regional specificities.

In 2024, Nissan announced that it would aim to reach cost parity (of production, not retail price) between electric and ICE cars by 2030. Emerging market and developing economies In EMDEs, the absence of small and cheaper electric car models is a significant hindrance to wider market uptake. Many of the available car models are SUVs or large models, targeting consumers of high-end goods, and far too expensive for mass-market consumers, who often do not own a personal car in the first place (see later sections on second-hand car markets and 2/3Ws). In India, while Tata’s small Tiago/Tigor models, which are priced between USD 10 000 and USD 15 000, accounted for about 20% of total electric car sales in 2023, the average best-selling small ICE car is priced around USD 7 000. Large models and SUVs accounted for over 65% of total electric car sales. While BYD announced in 2023 the goal of accounting for 40% of India’s EV market by 2030, all of its models available in India cost more than INR 3 million (Indian rupees) (USD 37 000), including the Seal, launched in 2024 for INR 4.1 million (USD 50 000). Similarly, SUVs and large models accounted for the majority share of electric car sales in Thailand (60%), Indonesia (55%), Malaysia (over 85%) and Viet Nam (over 95%). In Indonesia, for example, Hyundai’s Ionic 5 was the most popular electric car in 2023, priced at around USD 50 000. Looking at launch announcements, most new models expected over the 2024-2028 period in EMDEs are SUVs or large models. However, more than 50 small and medium models could also be introduced, and the recent or forthcoming entry of Chinese carmakers suggests that cheaper models could hit the market in the coming years. In 2022-2023, Chinese carmakers accounted for 40-75% of the electric car sales in Indonesia, Thailand and Brazil, with sales jumping as cheaper Chinese models were introduced. In Thailand, for example, Hozon launched its Neta V model in 2022 priced at THB 550 000 (Thai baht) (USD 15 600), which became a best- Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in electric cars PAGE | 48 IEA.

Similarly, in Indonesia, the market entry of Wuling’s Air EV in 2022-2023 was met with great success. In Colombia, the bestselling electric car in 2023 was the Chinese mini-car, Zhidou 2DS, which could be found at around USD 15 000, a competitive option relative to the country’s cheapest ICE car, the Kia Picanto, at USD 13 000.

Second-hand markets for electric cars are on the rise As electric vehicle markets mature, the second-hand market will become more important In the same way as for other technology products, second-hand markets for used electric cars are now emerging as newer generations of vehicles progressively become available and earlier adopters switch or upgrade. Second-hand markets are critical to foster mass-market adoption, especially if new electric cars remain expensive, and used ones become cheaper. Just as for ICE vehicles – for which buying second-hand is often the primary method of acquiring a car in both emerging and advanced economies – a similar pattern will emerge with electric vehicles.

As major electric car markets reach maturity, more and more used electric cars are becoming available for resale. Our estimates suggest that in 2023, the market size for used electric cars amounted to nearly 800 000 in China, 400 000 in the United States and more than 450 000 for France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom combined. Second-hand sales have not been included in the numbers presented in the previous section of this report, which focused on sales of new electric cars, but they are already significant. On aggregate, global second-hand electric car sales were roughly equal to new electric car sales in the United States in 2023. In the United States, used electric car sales are set to increase by 40% in 2024 relative to 2023. Of course, these volumes are dwarfed by second-hand ICE markets: 30 million in the European countries listed above combined, nearly 20 million in China, and 36 million in the United States. However, these markets have had decades to mature, indicating greater longer-term potential for used electric car markets. Used car markets already provide more affordable electric options in China, Europe and the United States Second-hand car markets are increasingly becoming a source of more affordable electric cars that can compete with used ICE equivalents. In the United States, for example, more than half of second-hand electric cars are already priced below 200 600 China EUR-6 United States Thousand 2022 Electric cars 10 000 20 000 30 000 40 000 China EUR-6 United States Conventional cars Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in electric cars PAGE | 50 IEA.

Moreover, the average price is expected to quickly fall towards USD 25 000, the price at which used electric cars become eligible for the federal used car rebate of USD 4 000, making them directly competitive with best-selling new and used ICE options. The price of a second-hand Tesla in the United States dropped from over USD 50 000 in early 2023 to just above USD 33 000 in early 2024, making it competitive with a second-hand SUV and many new models as well (either electric or conventional). In Europe, second-hand battery electric cars can be found between EUR 15 000 and EUR 25 000 (USD 16 000-27 000), and second-hand plug-in hybrids around EUR 30 000 (USD 32 000).

The resale value of battery electric cars sold after 36 months stood below 40% in 2017, but has since been closing the gap with other powertrains, reaching around 55% in mid-2022. This is the result of many factors, including higher prices of new electric cars, improving technology allowing vehicles and batteries to retain greater value over time, and increasing demand for second-hand electric cars. Similar trends have been observed in China. High or low resale values have important implications for the development of second-hand electric car markets and their contributions to the transition to road transport electrification. High resale values primarily benefit consumers of new cars (who retain more of the value of their initial purchase), and carmakers, because many consumers are attracted by the possibility of reselling their car after a few years, thereby fostering demand for newer models. High resale values also benefit leasing companies, which seek to minimise depreciation and resell after a few years. Leasing companies have a significant impact on second-hand markets because they own large volumes of vehicles for a shorter period (under three years, compared to 3 to 5 years for a private household). Their impact on markets for new cars can also be considerable: leasing companies accounted for over 20% of new cars sold in Europe in 2022. Overall, a resale value for electric cars on par with or higher than that of ICE equivalents contributes to supporting demand for new electric cars. In the near term, however, a combination of high prices for new electric cars and high resale 8 This metric of depreciation used in second-hand technology markets represents the value of the vehicle when being resold in relation to the value when originally purchased. A resale value of 70% means that a product purchased new will lose 30% of its original value, on average, and sell at such a discount relative to the original price.

In such cases, policy support can help bridge the gap with second-hand ICE prices. Difference between the relative resale value of battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles compared to gasoline conventional cars, 2023 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Notes: RV = resale value; BEV = battery electric vehicle; PHEV = plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. The y-axis shows the difference between the resale value of gasoline internal combustion engine (ICE) cars and battery electric and plug-in hybrid electric cars: a positive value means that EVs will lose less value than ICEs, while a negative value indicates a loss in value. Data is not available for PHEVs in China. This data shows the average across all segments in the second-hand market and does not correct for the difference in age between the powertrains. Sources: IEA analysis based on data from Autovista for resale values in European countries and from CADA for China. International trade for used electric cars to emerging markets is expected to increase As the EV stock ages in advanced markets, it is likely that more and more used EVs will be traded internationally, assuming that global standards enable technology compatibility (e.g. for charging infrastructure). Imported used vehicles present an opportunity for consumers in EMDEs, who may not have access to new models because they are either too expensive or not marketed in their countries. Data on used car trade flows are scattered and often contradictory, but the history of ICE cars can be a useful guide to what may happen for electric cars.

Used electric car exports from large EV markets have been growing in recent years. For China, this can be explained by the recent roll-back of a policy forbidding exports of used vehicles of any kind. Since 2019, as part of a pilot project, the government has granted 27 cities and provinces the right to export second-hand cars. In 2022, China exported almost 70 000 used vehicles, a significant increase on 2021, when fewer than 20 000 vehicles were exported. About 70% of these were NEVs, of which over 45% were exported to the Middle East. In 2023, the Ministry of Commerce released a draft policy on second-hand vehicle export that, once approved, will allow the export of second-hand vehicles from all regions of China. Used car exports from China are expected to increase significantly as a result. In the European Union, the number of used electric cars traded internationally is also increasing. In both 2021 and 2022, the market size grew by 70% year-onyear, reaching almost 120 000 electric cars in 2022. More than half of all trade takes place between EU member states, followed by trade with neighbouring countries such as Norway, the United Kingdom and Türkiye (accounting for 20% combined). The remainder of used EVs are exported to countries such as Mexico, Tunisia and the United States. As of 2023, the largest exporters are Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain. Last year, just over 1% of all used cars leaving Japan were electric. However these exports are growing and increased by 30% in 2023 relative to 2022, reaching 20 000 cars. The major second-hand electric car markets for Japanese vehicles are traditionally Russia and New Zealand (over 60% combined). After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, second-hand trade of conventional cars from Japan to Russia jumped sharply following a halt in operations of local OEMs in Russia, but this trade was quickly restricted by the Japanese government, thereby bringing down the price of second-hand cars in Japan. New Zealand has very few local vehicle assembly or manufacturing facilities, and for this reason many cars entering New Zealand are used imports. In 2023, nearly 20% of all electric cars that entered New Zealand were used imports, compared to 50% for the overall car market. In emerging economies, local policies play an important role in promoting or limiting trade flows for used cars. In the case of ICE vehicles, for example, some countries (e.g. Bolivia, Côte d’Ivoire, Peru) limit the maximum age of used car imports to prevent the dumping of highly polluting cars. Other countries Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in electric cars PAGE | 53 IEA. CC BY 4.0. (e.g. Brazil, Colombia, Egypt, India, South Africa) have banned used car imports entirely to protect their domestic manufacturing industries. Just as for ICE vehicles, policy measures can either help or hinder the import of used electric cars, such as by setting emission standards for imported used cars. Importing countries will also need to simultaneously support roll-out of charging infrastructure to avoid problems with access like those reported in Sri Lanka after an incentive scheme significantly increased imports of used EVs in 2018. The median age of vehicle imports tends to increase as the GDP per capita of a country decreases. In some African countries, the median age of imports is over 15 years. Beyond this timeframe, electric cars may require specific servicing to extend their lifetime. To support the availability of second-hand markets for electric cars, it will be important to develop strategies, technical capacity, and business models to swap very old batteries from used vehicles. Today, many countries that import ICE vehicles, including EMDEs, already have servicing capacity in place to extend the lifetimes of used ICE vehicles, but not used EVs. On the other hand, there are typically fewer parts in electric powertrains than in ICE ones, and these parts can even be more durable. Battery recycling capacity will also be needed, given that the importing country is likely to be where the imported EV eventually reaches end-of-life. Including end-of-life considerations in policy-making today can help mitigate the risk of longer-term environmental harm that could result from the accumulation of obsolete EVs and associated waste in EMDEs.

Including end-of-life considerations in policy-making today can help mitigate the risk of longer-term environmental harm that could result from the accumulation of obsolete EVs and associated waste in EMDEs. Policy choices in more mature markets also have an impact on possible trade flows. For example, the current policy framework in the European Union for the circularity of EV batteries may prevent EVs and EV batteries from leaving the European Union, which brings energy security advantages but might limit reuse. In this regard, advanced economies and EMDEs should strengthen co-operation to facilitate second-hand trade while ensuring adequate end-of-life strategies. For example, there could be incentives or allowances associated with extended vehicle lifetimes via use in second-hand markets internationally before recycling, as long as recycling in the destination market is guaranteed, or the EV battery is returned at end of life. Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in other light-duty vehicles PAGE | 54 IEA. CC BY 4.0. 2. Trends in other light-duty electric vehicles Electric two- and three-wheelers India, China and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries are the biggest two- and three-wheeler (2/3W)9 markets worldwide. In 2023, sales of 2/3Ws in these markets, including both electric and ICE powertrains, reached 19 million, 17 million and 14 million units, respectively. Indonesia, Viet Nam, the Philippines and Thailand are the biggest markets among ASEAN countries, with sales of 2/3Ws far outnumbering sales of LDVs, highlighting their importance in the region. Likewise, the number of 2/3Ws in India is 157 per 1 000 people, compared with only 35 passenger cars. Despite having smaller 2/3W markets overall, 2/3Ws also play a critical role in Latin America and Africa for daily passenger and commercial transportation. Electrifying 2/3Ws is therefore a promising lever for decarbonising mobility and improving urban air quality in these regions. In 2023, the sales share of electric 2/3Ws was just 13% globally, while in terms of stock shares, 2/3Ws represent the most electrified road transport segment, with about 8% of 2/3Ws being electric. China sold the most electric 2/3Ws in 2023, with over 30% of the 2/3W sales being electric (decreasing from about 50% in 2022), followed by India (8%) and ASEAN countries (3%). Global sales of electric two-wheelers continue to decline due to falling sales in China, though growth in the rest of Asia is steady The global market for electric two-wheelers (2Ws) shrank 18% in 2023, continuing the downward trend of 2022, which was almost entirely due to supply chain challenges stemming from China’s pandemic-related restrictions. The decline at the global level was largely driven by a 25% drop in China, which continues to command the vast majority of global electric 2W sales. The Chinese electric 2W market downturn could be explained by the continuing supply chain disruptions related to 2022 zero-Covid policies. 9 In this report, two-wheelers refer to vehicles with a top speed of at least 25 km/hr and which fit the L1 and L3 classes definition of UNECE. This excludes micromobility options such as electric-assisted bicycles and low-speed electric scooters. The definition of a three-wheeler is aligned with UNECE L2, L4 or L5 classes. Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in other light-duty vehicles PAGE | 55 IEA. CC BY 4.0. The fall in global electric 2W sales masks steady growth in the expanding Indian market and in some ASEAN countries. However, they are still dwarfed by China, which accounted for 78% of global sales, with nearly 6 million electric 2Ws sold in 2023, compared to 880 000 in India and 380 000 in ASEAN countries. In India – the second-largest electric 2W market globally – 2023 sales grew by 40% compared to 2022. The Indian electric 2W market is dominated by the five largest domestic manufacturers (Ola Electric, TVS Motor, Ather, Bajaj and Ampere), which accounted for more than 75% of sales. The rapid growth seen in India is the result of strong policy support for EV deployment, such as the FAME II measure, which was first introduced in 2019 as a three-year purchase incentive policy. FAME II came to an end on 31 March 2024, and will initially be replaced by a new four-month subsidy extension scheme called the Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme (EMPS), announced in March 2024, which outlays over INR 4.9 billion (Indian rupees) (almost USD 60 million) to subsidise electric 2/3W purchases. The EMPS aims to support the roll-out of 372 000 additional electric 2/3Ws equipped"}

The EMPS aims to support the roll-out of 372 000 additional electric 2/3Ws equipped with Li-ion batteries, bridging the gap between the FAME II scheme and potential future EV subsidies. Other policies such as the supply-side incentives under the PLI scheme, Goods and Service Tax (GST) and Regional Transport Office (RTO) tax rebates, along with India’s Go Electric campaign, have all helped bolster electric 2W uptake. As an illustration of the effect of the latest subsidy schemes, in 2023, the salesweighted average price of an electric 2W – after subsidies and tax rebates – was over 15% lower than its ICE equivalent, despite the upfront purchase price remaining around 30% higher on average. The savings potential of an electric 2W proves even more compelling from a TCO perspective. An electric 2W purchased in 2024 (assuming sales-weighted average prices from 2023) after 5 years of ownership would be more than 40% cheaper than its ICE equivalent over the same period (see figure below), despite the EMPS scheme offering reduced subsidies compared to FAME II. Although sales decreased to 250 000 units in 2023, Viet Nam remains the most dynamic electric 2W market amongst ASEAN countries, with a 9% share of 2W sales. ASEAN countries have the specificity of having higher share of scooters relative to other types of 2W, along with a high share of models equipped with lead-acid batteries, which accounted for 68% of electric 2W sales in 2020. The Vietnamese electric 2W market is dominated by a handful of home-grown manufacturers (such as VinFast, Pega and Dibao), whose overall manufacturing production capacity exceeds the local domestic sales, thus giving them the capacity to export to other ASEAN country markets. Elsewhere, Indonesia is aiming to increase its domestic electric motorbike manufacturing, allocating USD 455 million in subsidies to reach 800 000 new electric motorcycle sales, along with the conversion of 200 000 conventional motorcycles.

The Chinese market continues to have a high share of lead-acid batteries in sales, despite government efforts to ban this technology in low-speed EVs and encourage a transition towards Li-ion technology, motivated by environmental concerns associated with the afterlife of lead-acid batteries when not recycled properly. Due to their low upfront purchase price, lead-acid battery powered electric 3Ws remain a widespread transport technology across India and rural China. In India, estimates of their market share range from 55% to 98%. However, Li-ion batteries are expected to continue gaining ground in the Indian 3W market following the introduction of the 2024 EMPS subsidy scheme, which specifically aims to reduce the purchase price of models equipped with advanced battery chemistries. In 2023 in India, despite the upfront price being 55% higher than for its gasoline equivalent, the average electric 3W model (auto-rickshaw) is more than 50% cheaper to own after 8 years of service, and even without subsidies is over 40% cheaper (see figure above). Even when considering the most cost-effective ICE 3W running on natural gas, the electric model achieves TCO parity as soon as 2 years after purchase, and works out about 40% cheaper over an 8-year lifetime. However, subsidies still play an important role, as without them, the TCO breakeven point is only reached after 4 years. Electric light commercial vehicles One in twenty-five light commercial vehicles sold in 2023 was electric, following the path set by passenger cars The market for electric light commercial vehicles (LCVs) continued to increase in 2023. Global electric LCV sales grew by more than 50%, and the sales share grew to just under 5%. Two of the biggest electric LCV markets, China and Europe, saw a large increase in sales in 2023, as part of a broader trend of increasing LCV sales – both electric and ICE. In China, electric LCV sales exceeded 240 000, and in Europe, the electric LCV market leapt by 60% to reach almost 150 000. As the electric LCV market matures, several OEMs have announced new electric models and new partnerships. Some of these new models are designed specifically for niche commercial activities, such as the B-ON Pelkan electric delivery van. In a partnership with Uber, Kia announced a modular van design with a body that can be swapped from shuttling to last-mile delivery depending on activity. The average range of new LCVs increased by 55% between 2015 and 2023. For example, the two most popular electric LCV models in 2015 (Nissan e-NV200 and Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in other light-duty vehicles PAGE | 59 IEA. CC BY 4.0. the Renault Kangoo BEV) had a range of around 170 km. This compares to a much longer range – between 210 and 260 km – demonstrated by two very popular models (Hyundai Porter and Ford E-Transit) in 2023.

CC BY 4.0. 3. Trends in heavy electric vehicles Electric truck and bus sales The multiple benefits of city bus electrification boost adoption in advanced and emerging economies Sales of electric buses, comprising all medium- and large-sized buses, are far ahead of those of other heavy-duty vehicle (HDV) segments (including medium- and heavy-duty trucks10). Several European countries (such as Belgium, Norway and Switzerland) and China achieved sales shares above 50% in 2023, and more than one-fifth of bus sales were electric in Canada, Chile, Finland, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and Sweden. Globally, almost 50 000 electric buses were sold in 2023, equating to 3% of total bus sales and bringing the global stock to approximately 635 000 in total. This relatively low share is primarily due to the limited sales shares in most EMDEs, as well as the low market penetration of electric buses in some larger markets such as the United States and Korea. Early policy support for electrifying public transport, and the availability of domestically produced electric buses, coupled with incentives, meant that China took an early and significant lead in electric bus sales. In 2020, China was responsible for about 90% of electric bus sales worldwide. In 2023, this fell to around 60%, largely due to a decrease in domestic demand for both electric and ICE buses and, to a lesser extent, increasing sales in other regions. The fall in Chinese demand could be a consequence of the early success seen for electric buses – around 65% of China’s electric bus stock was deployed before 2019. It may also be linked to the ending of purchase subsidies for BEV and PHEV buses at the end of 2022. Despite China’s lead in global sales having shrunk, Chinese manufacturers continue to export large volumes of electric buses, accounting for over 85% of electric city bus deployments in Latin America. They have also increased their market share in the European Union from 10% of bus sales in 2017 to 30% in 2023, driven by companies such as Yutong and BYD. City buses, in particular, have strong potential for electrification thanks to their relatively fixed driving patterns and lower daily travel distances, and have spearheaded growth in electric bus sales.

There has also been encouraging progress in EMDEs, where a focus on the cobenefits of electric buses – such as reduced air pollution and greater access to public transport – has boosted take-up. This has been further supported by the wide availability of electric buses in already competitive markets. Cities across Latin America, such as Bogota and Santiago, have deployed nearly 6 500 electric buses to date. BasiGo, Africa’s largest electric bus company, has an order book of 350 buses, which represents almost 2% of electric bus sales outside of China in 2023, and aims to sell a further 1 000 electric buses in Kenya and 200 in Rwanda in the coming years. Along with high potential for electrification of city buses, infrastructure developments can also support the transition. The bus rapid transit (BRT) system, which is based on the use of dedicated bus lanes with priority access at intersections and off-board fare collection, can support the establishment of highcapacity, efficient services for cities. The new all-electric BRT system in Dakar – the first on the African continent – is a strong example. This network, announced at the end of 2023, will serve 320 000 passengers per day. Elsewhere, the European bus rapid transit of 2030 (eBRT2030) scheme aims to improve the urban transport environment by developing innovative solutions for electric BRTs, with demonstrations in Amsterdam, Athens, Barcelona and Prague, among other cities.

Electric truck sales are gaining momentum Sales of electric trucks increased 35% in 2023 compared to 2022, meaning that total sales of electric trucks surpassed electric buses for the first time, at around 54 000. China is the leading market for electric trucks, accounting for 70% of global sales in 2023, down from 85% in 2022. In Europe, electric truck sales increased almost threefold in 2023 to reach more than 10 000 (>1.5% sales share). The United States also saw a threefold increase, though electric truck sales reached just 1 200, less than 0.1% of total truck sales. We expect electric truck sales to continue to increase thanks to strong and ambitious policies, such as the European Union’s CO2 standards for HDVs, which target a 90% CO2 emissions reduction by 2040. In the United States, the newly adopted heavy-duty emissions regulation is expected to result in ZEV sales shares of up to 60% by 2032 in different segments. At the city level, zero emissions (or “green”) zones for freight, are being implemented in 15 different cities as diverse as London, Los Angeles, Madrid, Quito, Shenzhen, Seoul and Taoyuan City. Together, these cities have a total population of over 52 million. In addition, initiatives such as EV100+, the Global Memorandum of Understanding on Zero-Emission Medium and Heavy Duty Vehicles co-led by Drive to Zero, the European Clean Trucking Alliance, the eTransport coalition, the First Movers Coalition–Trucking, and the Fleet Electrification Coalition have increased their membership. They continue to advocate for more ambitious policies, such as accelerated sales targets and zero emission government fleets. In the United States, there have been efforts to use demonstration projects to identify truck segments ripe for electrification. In June 2023, the North American Council for Freight Efficiency, together with the Rocky Mountain Institute, launched Run on Less – Electric DEPOT. Through this initiative, depots deployed almost 300 electric trucks of various sizes to gather telemetry data with the aim of identifying use cases where electric trucks are already a viable solution, as well as where challenges remain.

Electric heavy-duty vehicle model availability China produces the largest selection of battery electric heavy-duty vehicles Chinese OEMs currently produce by far the largest number of models of battery electric HDVs – 430 in total – with a particular focus on buses suitable for urban public transport, which make up almost 40% of all models. 11 In 2021 alone, Chinese OEMs released almost 150 bus models, providing more choice and covering more applications in what was already the world’s largest electric bus market. Since 2021, the number of additional new models has continued to grow, but with a more even distribution across different segments – over 65 new models 11 Excludes minibuses, i.e. buses with 25 seats or fewer. Where the number of seats changes by 5 or less, variations of the same model are counted as one throughout this analysis. For the purposes of this calculation, buses suitable for urban public transport are defined as having a seating capacity of between 30 and 70. 10 30 50 70 2015 2019 2023 Thousand China Europe United States Other 0.0% 0.5% 1.0% 1.5% 2.0% 2.5% 3.0% 3.5% 4.0% 2017 2021 Sales Sales share Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in heavy electric vehicles PAGE | 64 IEA. CC BY 4.0. for buses, and around 40 each for medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks – thereby enabling wider electrification. A significant number of models is now available in each segment in China. North American OEMs produce a far smaller number of battery electric models – over 170 – with a greater emphasis on the medium-duty truck market, which accounts for more than 60% of all models. New brands such as Rizon are targeting the electric medium-duty segment in North America, where despite their higher upfront costs, electric trucks are already competitive with diesel trucks in terms of total cost of ownership, especially when charged at depot as opposed to highercost public charging. Costs are even more competitive when factoring in incentives available in the United States and Canada. Though both the United States and Canada also have policy incentives specifically targeting buses, they have relatively small public transport markets and, as a consequence, buses suitable for urban public transport make up just over 10% of all models. Instead, OEMs have targeted the school bus niche, producing nine different models excluding minibuses. Despite producing a lower number of battery electric models overall, at around 120, European OEMs offer the most even distribution of models across segments. They also have the highest share of heavy-duty trucks, with more than 20% of all models. This has allowed European OEMs, in particular the Volvo group (which includes the Mack, Renault, and Dongfeng (joint venture) truck brands), to gain a large share of not only the European, but also the North American heavy-duty electric truck market. European OEMs also produce a significant number of niche vehicles such as refuse trucks (around 10% of all models), which – like mediumduty trucks – are already cost-competitive with their ICE counterparts. On average, individual Chinese OEMs produce more models across segments, which differentiates Chinese OEMs from those in other regions. Only about half of Chinese OEMs produce models for a single segment, compared to around 70% in North America and Europe. Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in heavy electric vehicles PAGE | 65 IEA.

This figure is based on a continuously updated inventory but may not be fully comprehensive due to new model announcements and small manufacturers not yet captured in the database. Values for 2020 include models released between 2016 and 2020 inclusive. The database contains coaches, school buses, shuttle buses, and transit buses, categorised here as “Bus”, which refers to those with more than 25 seats. “MD truck” includes medium-duty (MD) trucks, MD step vans, and cargo vans with a gross vehicle weight (GVW) of greater than 3.5 t but less than 15 t. “HD truck” includes all freight trucks with a GVW of greater than 15 t. “Specialised truck” includes garbage/refuse trucks, concrete mixers, and other specialised mobile commercial trucks. Buses with 25 seats or fewer and light commercial vehicles, which have a GVW of less than 3.5 t, are excluded from this analysis. Vehicles of the same model that appear more than once in the database, but with small variations in specifications, such as battery capacity, payload or seating, are counted as one model. Sources: IEA analysis based on the Global Drive to Zero ZETI tool database. Model availability is a key indicator of the growing maturity of the battery electric HDV market, but the number of OEMs is also important for assessing competition and ability to meet future demand. The number of OEMs producing electric HDVs in China trebled between 2020 and 2023, from 12 to 36, in response to increasing sales of electric trucks domestically, as well as increasing electric bus sales abroad. In addition to growth in the number of Chinese OEMs, companies such as BYD, Skywell, Dongfeng and Foton have also expanded their offerings, with models in the bus, MD truck, and HD truck segments, offering potential advantages in terms of economies of scale and supply chains. The strength of the domestic market may also have allowed Chinese firms to build more robust supply chains. North America also experienced an almost threefold increase in the number of HDV OEMs between 2020 and 2023, from 16 to 45. Early support in states such as California and anticipation of national policies supported investment in HDV manufacturing, which was later boosted by demand incentives and regulations. 50 150 250 350 450 2020 2021 2022 2023 2020 2021 2022 2023 2020 2021 2022 2023 2020 2021 2022 2023 China North America Europe Rest of world Number of electric models available Bus MD truck HD truck Specialised truck Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in heavy electric vehicles PAGE | 66 IEA.

United States-based OEMs typically specialise in models for a smaller number of segments than Chinese OEMs. Only Lion offers vehicles in the bus, MD truck, and HD truck categories, along with Exro’s recently acquired SEA Electric, which builds vehicles for different applications by adapting its powertrain to glider chassis platforms from other OEMs. Europe had the highest number of HDV OEMs in 2020, but still saw a 50% increase between 2020 and 2023 to reach 36, the same number as China but less than the United States. Established OEMs such as Volvo Trucks, MAN, Mercedes, and Quantron offer vehicles in three or more segments. This wide range of offerings, coupled with an already strong position in the global market, and relatively low sales shares in Europe prior to 2023, meant there was less space for new entrants to compete.

CC BY 4.0. 4. Trends in electric vehicle charging Charging for electric light-duty vehicles There are almost ten times as many private chargers as public ones, with most owners charging at home Home charging is currently the most common means of charging electric cars. EV owners with access to a private parking space that can be equipped for charging can charge overnight, which is not only convenient but also typically takes advantage of lower electricity prices while demand is relatively low. The availability of home charging varies substantially between regions and is linked to differences in urban, suburban and rural populations, as well as income bracket. In dense cities, where most people live in multi-unit dwellings, access to home charging is more limited and EV owners rely more heavily on public charging. This is most apparent in Korea, which is one of the world’s most densely populated countries and has the highest ratio of public charging capacity to EVs. Though access to charging is different to actual use, it is a useful proxy for the levels of home charging among EV owners across countries. The share of EVs in new car sales is over 90% in Norway, whereas it stands at under 2% in Mexico, yet the shares of EV owners reportedly charging at home are similar, at 82% and 71%, respectively. The United Kingdom has one of the highest reported shares of access to home charging, at 93%, more than half of which are smart chargers.12 This is partly due to the United Kingdom being the first country to release smart charge point regulations, but, importantly, it could also be attributed to the high share of early EV adopters that also own a home in which a charger can be installed. In India, 55% of consumers state that they have access to home charging today. Changes to building regulations in order to mandate chargers, as have been proposed by the European Union, are an effective way of increasing access over time, especially for people who live in rented accommodation. In regions where the voltage of the power grid is 220V or above, EV owners can charge their vehicle from a regular domestic socket overnight. This is the most 12 Smart chargers are defined in the study concerned as being chargers connected to the internet such that they can be operated remotely to optimise energy consumption. Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in electric vehicle charging PAGE | 68 IEA. CC BY 4.0. common case and holds true in Europe, Australia, large parts of Latin America, and most of Asia. In regions where the voltage is lower, typically 100-120V, recharging speeds from regular domestic sockets are much slower,13 and can present a safety risk. As such, in countries with a 100-120V power grid, the ability to recharge in under ten hours requires installation of a dedicated charger.14 This is the case in some countries where the share of EV charging at home is high, such as the United States (83%) and Canada (80%). However, it also includes developing countries with ambitious electrification targets, such as Indonesia, Costa Rica and Colombia, where both the cost (in the region of several hundred US dollars) and lower availability of private parking spaces may present significant hurdles to private charger installation. Reliance on more expensive public charging may therefore be higher. Beyond home charging, private charging also includes other non-publicly accessible chargers, such as chargers reserved for the employees, fleets or customers of certain establishments. There are, for example, 15 900 such private non-home chargers in the United States. In the European Union, over 250 000 chargers are described as having restricted access. While home charging infrastructure is well established in many countries, the landscape for 2Ws is markedly different. Stock and sales of 2Ws continue to increase in India"}

While home charging infrastructure is well established in many countries, the landscape for 2Ws is markedly different. Stock and sales of 2Ws continue to increase in India and the ASEAN countries. These growing markets also see growing momentum in battery swapping technologies, especially in India. In 2023, the Chinese Taipei-based battery-swapping company Gogoro announced a USD 2.5 billion partnership with the Indian State of Maharashtra. Gogoro intends to invest more than USD 1.5 billion in deploying smart battery infrastructure, which will include their battery swapping stations. Other Indian start-ups such as Sun Mobility and Battery Smart raised USD 50 million and USD 33 million, respectively, for further expansion of battery swapping infrastructure. Elsewhere, Africa has also seen increased investment in battery-swapping technologies for 2Ws. Ampersand, a Rwanda-based company, currently performs 140 000 monthly battery swaps to more than 1 700 customers that together travel 1.4 million km every week in Kigali and Nairobi. Spiro, an African electric 2W startup, secured around USD 60 million in 2023 in order to expand its electric fleet and fund more than 1 000 swap stations. 13 Assuming a fuel economy of 20 kWh/100 km and charger power of 1 kW, 10 hours of lower-voltage overnight charging can provide 50 km range to an electric car, whereas electric 2/3Ws have battery capacities of under 8 kWh and consume approximately 3 kWh/100 km, and can therefore fully charge in the same time. 14 Dedicated chargers allow for AC charging above 3.7 kW and up to 22 kW.

Sources: IEA analysis based on country submissions. Governments are strengthening support for public charging infrastructure Although there are many more private chargers, public charging and the interoperability of its infrastructure is key to enabling more widespread adoption of and more equitable access to EVs. The public charging stock increased by more than 40% in 2023, and the growth of fast chargers – which reached 55% – outpaced that of slow chargers.15 At the end of 2023, fast chargers represented over 35% of public charging stock. Overall, China leads electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) deployment, with more than 85% of the world's fast chargers, and around 60% of slow chargers. Having achieved an electric car sales share of over 35%, thus already surpassing their policy ambition for 2025, China is shifting focus to charging infrastructure development, targeting full coverage in cities and on highways by 2030, as well as expanded rural coverage. China has also begun to support more sustainable charging behaviour, with the aim that 60% of EV charging occurs off-peak by 2025, starting with five pilot cities. 15 Slow chargers have power ratings less than or equal to 22 kW, whereas fast chargers have a power rating of more than 22 kW and up to 350 kW. “Charging points” and “chargers” are used interchangeably and refer to the individual charging sockets, reflecting the number of EVs that can charge at the same time. 5 15 25 35 45 2016 2018 2020 2022 Private - home Private - other Public - slow Public - fast Million Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in electric vehicle charging PAGE | 70 IEA.

Canada is currently on track to meet its target of 33 500 charging ports by 2026. Developing markets are also increasingly recognising the importance of EVSE, such as India, which provided funding for over 7 000 fast chargers in 2023. As the number of public chargers grows, attention is also turning to the interoperability of charging infrastructure. In the United States, SAE International announced it would use Tesla’s charging connector (J3400) as the standard across North America under the North American Charging Standard (NACS). The aim is to ensure that any supplier or manufacturer is able to use and deploy the connector, providing EV drivers with more options for reliable, convenient charging across North America. Both the AFIR regulation in Europe, and the NACS in North America, are examples of legislation enacted to enhance interoperability of the charging infrastructure. Achieving greater interoperability across more regions will require enhanced collaboration amongst all stakeholders in order to agree common standards and protocols. Public charging roll-out needs to keep pace with electric vehicle sales Deployment of EV chargers should be co-ordinated with power grid developments to ensure that new connections are consistent with the wider grid-planning horizon. When not managed appropriately, charging can lead to a surge in peak demand, meaning that it is increasingly important to ensure that transmission and distribution grids are appropriately sized and equipped.17 Strategies to manage charging, such as through time-of-use tariffs and smart-charging, will become more necessary as EV deployment grows. High ratios of publicly available charging capacity to EVs in use are crucial in regions where home charging is less accessible, and can help improve the consumer experience more widely. Sufficient coverage reduces concerns about range, and can allow for vehicles with lower battery capacity, thereby reducing costs and critical material demand. Accurately planning for the most appropriate ratio can prove challenging due to the varying supply and demand dynamics within individual countries.

In 2023, the Australian Government announced that it will provide AUD 39.3 million (Australian dollars) to the National Roads and Motorists’ Association, through the Driving the Nation Fund, to build EV chargers along national highways.

Charging for electric heavy-duty vehicles Dedicated charging for heavy-duty vehicles is the next frontier Electric HDVs can generally use the same charging points as LDVs, but the larger size of both the vehicle and battery, and the resulting longer charging times required can disrupt normal operations, ultimately creating a need for dedicated equipment and facilities.

In essence, this provided recognition of the adoption of the megawatt charging system (MCS) – which allows charging capacity up to 3.75 MW – by international standardisation organisations such as SAE International and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Some companies such as Kempower, who mainly operate in Europe but are expanding globally, are expected to introduce chargers designed to operate at up to 1.2 MW in 2024, ahead of the formal standardisation of the MCS, though this is not expected to cause issues of divergence. In Asia, predominantly in China and Japan, the ChaoJi-2 began demonstration in late 2023. Although ChaoJi-2 has a lower power rating than the MCS (up to 1.2 MW), it allows for compatibility with existing standards in the region.18 In March 2024, the United States released the National Zero-Emission Freight Corridor Strategy. This sets out a phased approach to electrifying road freight, starting with establishing charging hubs at locations such as rail yards and airports, before expanding the network with the aim of achieving full coverage sometime between 2035 and 2040. Smaller demonstrations have also been undertaken, such as the Run on Less – Electric DEPOT scheme, through which around 140 charging points were installed at 10 depots across the United States. According to data collected by the Atlas EV Hub, a further 210 charging points are already operating in the United States to serve electric trucks, and another 1 020 are planned, around 75% of which are due to be completed in 2024. The weighted 18 Maximum powers are based on specifications of 1 250 V and 3 000 A for MCS, and 1 500 V and 800 A for ChaoJi. Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in electric vehicle charging PAGE | 76 IEA. CC BY 4.0. average capacity of chargers whose power was included in the database is 180 kW, with almost 95% being direct current fast chargers. To date, there are around 160 truck-specific charging points deployed in Europe. In early 2023, Europe’s first truck charging corridor was launched along a 600 km stretch of the Rhine-Alpine corridor, one of the busiest road freight routes in Europe. All 6 public charging locations are fitted with 300 kW charging points. The company behind the corridor, BP pulse, is also electrifying one of the largest truck stops in the United Kingdom. Looking forward, the EU AFIR details the progressive roll-out of minimum coverage and capacity for HDV charging stations, specifying that each station must include at least one charger of at least 350 kW power output by the end of 2025. Alongside national policies, AFIR has sparked the creation of several pilot programmes dedicated to charging HDVs using MCS charging, such as HoLa, ZEFES, HV-MELA-BAT, and a joint ABB and Scania project. In late 2023, Milence, an independent joint venture established by Traton, Volvo and Daimler, presented their HDV charger. In collaboration with Hitachi Energy, they plan to build 1 700 public charging points across Europe by 2027, based on the MCS. Although high-powered charging can enable the decarbonisation of freight, it may also present challenges for the electricity grid, like fluctuations in power quality or supply-demand imbalances. These imbalances can cause grid congestion at the local level, and could affect entire regions where there is a large electric HDV fleet. Some countries, such as the Netherlands, are already developing policies to anticipate these issues. One way to mitigate challenges and avoid peak demand is through stationary storage batteries that are co-located with high-powered chargers. This solution would require significant capital expenditure (CAPEX) for the installation of large, stationary batteries, but it could also offer new revenue streams to charging station owners, such as through electricity price arbitrage or grid services provision. Co-locating renewable sources close to charging hubs can also decrease the stress on the local power grid. The electricity grid is a key enabling technology for HDV electrification, and careful planning and investment will be required in order to accommodate new loads.

CC BY 4.0. battery swapping and electric road systems, both of which can potentially offer significant advantages compared to high-powered charging. Battery swapping can be completed in as little as five minutes, can help to extend battery life through more controlled charging, and can spread power demand over a longer period, thus reducing pressure on the electricity grid. Battery swapping is currently most developed in China, where it has been encouraged by national and local governments since 2020. As many as half of electric heavy-duty trucks sold in 2023 were enabled with battery-swapping technology. In late 2022, SAIC launched a joint venture to set up around 40 battery swapping stations in cities such as Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Shenzhen, with the aim of installing 3 000 stations by 2025. In 2023, CATL, the world’s largest producer of EV batteries, launched QIJI Energy, an all-in-one heavy-duty truck chassis batteryswapping solution, which aims to reduce costs by building upon existing battery technology. Electric road systems (ERS) allow vehicles to charge while they are driving, using one of three main technologies: induction between the vehicle and the road, conduction connections between the vehicle and road, or catenary lines.19 With increased access to charging through ERS, vehicles would require less battery capacity, leading to reduced battery demand and a more equal distribution of power demand throughout the day, with the trade-off being a greater and more distributed overall infrastructure requirement. ERS have significantly progressed in countries including Sweden, France, Germany, Italy, Israel and the United States. In 2023, Sweden became the first country in the world to commit to turning a highway into a permanently electrified road. Though the exact charging method has yet to be decided, the planned road should open to the public by 2025, with up to 3 000 km of further road expansion by 2045. In France, a study for the Ministry of Transport on the impact of ERS concluded that it could reduce CO2 emissions by 86% for road freight trucks that currently run on diesel. The installation of nearly 5 000 km of ERS by 2030 has been proposed, and the first stage of this project is expected in 2024 with a proof of concept being installed on 2 km of motorway to the southwest of Paris. In Germany, a catenary system was installed over 10 km of motorway in 2019 as part of a pilot trial, and a further 7 km have since been added , with long-term aspirations for the entire A5 motorway to be fitted with ERS. Other countries such as Italy and Israel have already completed proof-of-concept trials run by Electreon. 19 Catenary lines can only be used for HDVs due to the suspension of overhead wires for delivering electricity. Conductive charging works for both HDVs and LDVs where there is a conductive system embedded in the road. Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in electric vehicle batteries PAGE | 78 IEA. CC BY 4.0. 5.

Nevertheless, the United States remains the smallest market of the three, with around 100 GWh in 2023, compared to 185 GWh in Europe and 415 GWh in China. In the rest of the world, battery demand growth jumped to more than 70% in 2023 compared to 2022, as a result of increasing EV sales. In China, PHEVs accounted for about one-third of total electric car sales in 2023 and 18% of battery demand, up from one-quarter of total sales in 2022 and 17% of sales in 2021. PHEV batteries are smaller than those used in BEVs, thereby contributing less to increasing battery demand. In recent years, Chinese carmakers have also been marketing more extended-range EVs (EREVs), which use an electric motor as their unique powertrain but have a combustion engine that can be used to recharge the battery when needed. EREVs typically have a battery size about twice that of a PHEV, enabling a real-world electric range of around 150 km compared to 65 km for traditional PHEVs. With an ICE on board, EREVs can reach ranges of around 1 000 km when needed. In 2023, EREVs accounted for 25% of PHEV sales in China, up from about 15% in 2021-2022. Negligible EREV sales are recorded in other regions. Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in electric vehicle batteries PAGE | 79 IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Source: IEA analysis based on data from EV Volumes. More batteries means extracting and refining greater quantities of critical raw materials, particularly lithium, cobalt and nickel Rising EV battery demand is the greatest contributor to increasing demand for critical metals like lithium. Battery demand for lithium stood at around 140 kt in 2023, 85% of total lithium demand and up more than 30% compared to 2022; for cobalt, demand for batteries was up 15% at 150 kt, 70% of the total. To a lesser extent, battery demand growth contributes to increasing total demand for nickel, accounting for over 10% of total nickel demand. Battery demand for nickel stood at almost 370 kt in 2023, up nearly 30% compared to 2022. High levels of investment in mining and refining in the past 5 years have ensured that global supply can comfortably meet demand today, not only for EVs but also in historical markets including portable electronics, ceramics, metals and alloys. In 2023, the supply of cobalt and nickel exceeded demand by 6.5% and 8%, and supply of lithium by over 10%, thereby bringing down critical mineral prices and battery costs. While low critical mineral prices help bring battery costs down, they also imply lower cash flows and narrower margins for mining companies. Compared to just a few years earlier, overcapacity means that many companies are now struggling to stay afloat (see later section on trends in the EV industry). Mining and refining will need to continue growing quickly to meet future demand, to avoid supply chain bottlenecks and make supply chains more resilient to potential disruptions. Doing so will also require striking a balance between remaining profitable while competing on prices. Innovative technologies such as sodium-ion batteries can potentially mitigate demand for critical minerals, together with the rise of mature battery chemistries requiring lower amounts of critical metals, such as lithium iron phosphate (LFP). 100 300 500 700 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 GWh / year LDV Two/three-wheeler Bus Truck 100 300 500 700 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 China Europe United States RoW Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in electric vehicle batteries PAGE | 80 IEA.

Battery production is located close to demand centres, with international partnerships playing an important role in global expansion The majority of battery demand for EVs today can be met with domestic or regional production in China, Europe and the United States. However, the share of imports remains relatively large in Europe and the United States, meeting more than 20% and more than 30% of EV battery demand, respectively. China is the world’s largest EV battery exporter, with around 12% of its EV batteries being exported. Production in Europe and the United States reached 110 GWh and 70 GWh of EV batteries in 2023, and 2.5 million and 1.2 million EVs, respectively. In Europe, the largest battery producers are Poland, which accounted for about 60% of all EV batteries produced in the region in 2023, and Hungary (almost 30%). Germany leads the production of EVs in Europe and accounted for nearly 50% of European EV production in 2023, followed by France and Spain (with just under 10% each). Battery production in China is more integrated than in the United States or Europe, given China’s leading role in upstream stages of the supply chain. China represents nearly 90% of global installed cathode active material manufacturing capacity and over 97% of anode active material manufacturing capacity today. The only countries with significant shares of cathode active material manufacturing capacity outside of China today are Korea (9%) and Japan (3%). Different supply chains are, however, required for different chemistries. China is home to almost 100% of the LFP production capacity and more than threequarters of the installed lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) and other nickel-based chemistries production capacity, compared to 20% in Korea.

China’s current leading role in battery production, however, comes at the cost of high levels of overcapacity. In 2023, excluding portable electronics, China used less than 40% of its maximum cell output, 20 and cathode and anode active material installed manufacturing capacity was almost 4 and 9 times greater than global EV cell demand in 2023. To take advantage of some of this excess capacity, China is the biggest exporter of EV cells, cathodes and anodes globally. However, this has significantly decreased producers’ margins, which may put some at risk if they do not find enough customers outside of China.

In comparison, NMC batteries were less than 25% more expensive than their LFP equivalents in 2023, down from a premium of 50% in 2021. LFP batteries remain significantly cheaper than NMC, and their price has recently decreased rapidly. Further innovation-driven improvements are foreseen for both chemistries through recent battery pack configurations, such as cell-to-pack21 (already being adopted for LFP) and cell-to-chassis. In addition, continued innovation in manufacturing is helping to achieve improved battery performance, for example through multi-layer electrodes enabling ultra-fast charging.

For example, producing a battery cell in the United States is nearly 20%22 more expensive than in China, even when assuming that material costs do not vary regionally. In reality, Chinese manufacturers are likely to benefit from preferential prices from local material producers and a more integrated supply chain within China, which could mean the manufacturing cost gap is even larger. Moreover, contrary to the United States and Europe, most Chinese batteries are LFP, which is more than 20% cheaper to produce than NMC. 21 Battery packs used in EVs are typically made of a series of modules, each containing several battery cells. In the cell-topack configuration, battery cells are assembled to build a pack without using modules, which reduces the need for inert materials and increases energy density. In cell-to-chassis concepts, battery cells are used as part of the EV structure without being assembled into a battery pack beforehand. 22 Calculations from the BNEF BattMan 3.1.0 model using NMC811 as cathode and graphite as anode.

Sources: IEA analysis based on data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The battery industry is accelerating plans to develop more affordable chemistries and novel designs Over the last five years, LFP has moved from a minor share to the rising star of the battery industry, supplying more than 40% of EV demand globally by capacity in 2023, more than double the share recorded in 2020. LFP production and adoption is primarily located in China, where two-thirds of EV sales used this chemistry in 2023. The share of LFP batteries in EV sales in Europe and the United States remains below 10%, with high-nickel chemistries still most common in these markets. LFP was first invented in the United States in 1997, and further developed in Canada through the early 2000s, but thanks to a favourable intellectual property agreement, China has been the only country mass-producing LFP batteries since the 2010s. In 2022, the core LFP patents expired, sparking interest in production outside of China. The recent surge in interest in LFP chemistries has led to major investments in Morocco, which is home to the world’s largest phosphate reserves and, importantly, holds free-trade agreements with the United States and Europe. In 2022, Morocco saw almost as many announced investments to as in the five previous years combined, reaching USD 15.3 billion.

Manufacturing capacity outside China is still at the laboratory or pilot scale. In 2023, leading battery manufacturers announced expansion plans for sodiumion batteries, such as BYD, Northvolt and CATL, which initially sought to reach mass production by the end of the same year. If brought to scale, sodium-ion batteries could cost up to 20% less than incumbent technologies and be suitable for applications such as compact urban EVs and power stationary storage, while enhancing energy security. The development and cost advantages of sodium-ion batteries are, however, strongly dependent on lithium prices, with current low prices discouraging investments in sodium-ion and delaying expansion plans.

Trends in the electric vehicle industry Electric vehicle company strategy and market competition Electric vehicle companies perform well in financial markets, but volatility and competition raise concern Since 2019, the stocks of EV companies – including vehicle and battery manufacturers and companies involved in the extraction or processing of battery metals – have consistently outperformed general stock markets, major traditional carmakers, and other segments of clean technology. Return on investment has increased more over the 2019-2023 period for these companies than it has for others, in relative terms. The combined market capitalisation of pure play EV makers boomed from USD 100 billion in 2020 to USD 1 trillion at the end of 2023, with a peak over USD 1.6 trillion at the end of 2021, though this trend was primarily driven by Tesla. The market capitalisation of battery makers and battery metal companies also increased significantly over the same period. Behind this overall upward trend, however, there has been significant volatility. Supply chain disruptions and battery metal price fluctuations – notably in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – as well as increasing competition, price wars among OEMs and expectations of slower relative annual growth as major EV markets mature, and of possible consolidation, are having an important downward impact on investor confidence and EV stocks. For example, Tesla’s shares were on average 15% lower in 2023 than in 2021-2022; BYD’s average stock also fell 15% in 2023 relative to 2022; and the combined market capitalisation of pure play EV carmakers fell by nearly 20% on average relative to 2022, while that of major"}

Many emerging EV players – such as VinFast from Viet Nam, Polestar from Europe, and Canoo, Fisker, Lucid and Nikola from the United States – are missing sales targets and trading low. Fiercer competition and shrinking profits also have an impact upstream, among EV battery makers: in the first weeks of 2024, CATL was trading near a three-year low, with a market capitalisation at its lowest point since the end of 2020. In the first quarter of 2024, the combined market capitalisation of pure play EV players fell below that of major incumbents, even if their financial stock performance remained robust.

As we reported last year in GEVO-2023, companies and investors are exploring new opportunities upstream in EV supply chains, especially as competition intensifies. Carmakers are seeking to secure direct deals with battery makers and companies involved in the mining and processing of critical minerals. Investors including large banks and funds are pouring capital into the metal industry. In 2023, Stellantis announced a partnership in Argentina to secure projected copper demand, investing USD 155 million. Volkswagen, Glencore and Chrysler each invested USD 100 million in a Special Purpose Acquisition Company operating nickel and copper assets, supported by several global investment banks for an overall USD 1 billion deal. In 2024, Tesla and several Korean battery makers, including LG and SK, met with Chilean government agencies regarding lithium supply, primarily with the aim of supplying the US market with the support of IRA tax credits.

The margins for lithium, nickel and copper companies typically outperformed those of the top 100 mining companies over the same period, including relative to gold or iron ore. However, the picture in 2023 and the first quarter of 2024 is changing. The volatile metal prices seen in the past few years, the increasing competition and pressure to drive down EV and battery prices, and the current overcapacity for several critical minerals (see earlier section on batteries), mean that major mining companies are revisiting growth and performance forecasts. After several years of important cash flows as a result of high prices and increasing volumes, many companies are now starting to struggle to finance both existing and new projects with their own revenues, suggesting external sources will be needed for largescale capital expenditure. In Australia, for example, Albemarle, Core Lithium, Liontown Resources and Pilbara Minerals announced project spending reductions, lower dividends, and job cuts in 2024. Albermarle expects capital expenditures to drop by around USD 500 million from USD 2.1 billion in 2023 to USD 1.6-1.8 billion in 2024, and plans to reduce annual costs by nearly USD 100 million. Pilbara Minerals expects annual exploration spending to be cut by up to AUD 100 million (USD 66 million). Nickel and cobalt projects in Australia have also been delayed or halted, involving companies like BHP, First Quantum Minerals and Wyloo Metals. First Quantum Minerals expects a 30% staff cut as a result of reduced operations. In the United States, Piedmont Lithium Inc. is letting go of 25% of staff. Over the 2024-2026 period, we could see progressive consolidation of critical mineral extraction and refining projects and businesses around lowest-cost producers.

Global competition is getting tougher, pushing down company margins Road transport electrification is reshuffling cards in global markets, as carmakers compete fiercely to capture their share of a growing pie. BYD and Tesla remain far ahead of the curve, together accounting for 35% of all electric car sales in 2023. This is more than all the major carmakers outside China combined (just above 30%), and more than all the other Chinese carmakers (just under 30%). BYD and Tesla’s rise as global front-runners has primarily dented the market share of major incumbents, which accounted for 55% of global electric car sales in 2015 but have been falling behind ever since. In 2022, BYD had already overtaken Tesla as the world’s best-selling EV company when accounting for plug-in hybrid cars. In the second half of 2023, BYD also became the world’s best-selling battery electric car company. Counting both BEV and PHEV models, BYD’s share of global electric car markets was just over 20%. In China, BYD also became the top-selling car company with over 2.4 million new registrations or 11% of the domestic market, ahead of Volkswagen, which had been China’s best-selling brand for over 15 years.

In China, since the end of 2022, greater competition among front-runners has led electric car prices to fall quickly. The price of compact electric cars and SUVs dropped by up to 10% in 2023 relative to 2022. In the first quarter of 2024, Tesla once again slashed prices, by up to 6% or CNY 15 000 for its Models 3 and Y, forcing competitors to follow by squeezing margins. BYD proceeded with a 1020% cut on model prices, such as a CNY 10 000 reduction on its flagship Qin Plus; XPeng with a CNY 20 000 cut on its G6 series; and the GM-SAIC-Wuling joint venture with a CNY 6 000 cut on its Xingguang sedan. Tesla has been able to afford such a strategy thus far thanks to a focus on highend models and greater profits per car sold, around USD 10 000 to USD 15 000 per electric car sold in 2022-2023 against around USD 6 000 for BYD, which also explains why Tesla’s market value in 2023 remained 7 times higher than that of BYD. BYD’s preferred strategy has been to sell cheaper models and protect margins by developing in-house battery supply chains. Other Chinese makers are now actively seeking to catch up by announcing new models. For example, XPeng announced new models for 2024 priced at around CNY 100 000-150 000, far more affordable than the premium models typically priced in the range of CNY 300 000. However, just one-third of Chinese carmakers (e.g. Li Auto, BYD, Geely) met their sales targets in 2023, while others (e.g. Nio, Xpeng, Leap, Great Wall) fell short for the second straight year. 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% '15 '16 '17 '18 '19 '20 '21 '22 '23 Market share BYD Tesla CATL Chinese carmakers Major carmakers Major battery makers 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% '15 '16 '17 '18 '19 '20 '21 '22 '23 '24e '25e Gross margin Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in the electric vehicle industry PAGE | 93 IEA.

Global competition is expected to further intensify in the coming years, especially as Chinese carmakers look to export in the context of battery and EV oversupply. Just as for steel and solar PV, China’s subsidised industrial strategy for EVs, which was initiated 15 years ago, has led to significant excess capacity. Capacity utilisation stood below 70% among the top 10 sellers in the first months of 2023. There are also far more EV companies in China than can possibly survive in a competitive market. In 2014 alone, ten years ago, over 80 000 companies registered in China entered the electromobility sector. In 2023, over 80% of electric car sales in China were concentrated in just over 30 companies. In 2024, the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology noted its concern that too many carmakers remain unprofitable. Nio, for example, recorded net losses of USD 3 billion in 2023. As shrinking margins push the least profitable out of the race, China’s EV industry is consolidating around a smaller number of robust champions – and they are looking abroad for expansion. Chinese auto exports grew steeply in 2023, up 60% relative to 2022, making China the world’s largest car exporter, ahead of Japan and Germany. Despite high import taxes (e.g. 27% in the United States and 10% in the European Union) and tight regulatory scrutiny (e.g. the anti-subsidy EU investigation on EV imports since October 2023 and possible introduction of new tariffs from July 2024), Chinese OEMs often remain more competitive than incumbents. They could be well-placed to capture market share in the near term, especially in the small car segment. In early 2024, for example, BYD chartered its first cargo ship, with a capacity of 7 000 cars sailing to Europe. European and US carmakers are under growing pressure as Chinese carmakers start to export at scale, and are adjusting corporate strategy accordingly. In February 2024, for example, Ford and GM expressed that they could even be open to partnering to compete against Chinese carmakers, and BYD in particular. Ford estimates losses on EV investments of up to USD 5.5 billion in 2023, and expects even tougher future competition from more affordable Tesla models and Chinese carmakers. Another example comes from Stellantis, which – considering the growing importance of Chinese pure play EV manufacturers on the global market – recently became an important shareholder of China’s Leapmotor brand.

Electric vehicle and battery start-ups Venture capital investments in electric vehicle start-ups dropped in 2023, following the global trend Venture capital (VC) funding to EV start-ups has boomed in the past decade. Financial investors such as banks and VC or private equity funds see in EV startups a potential for significant future returns. Many companies – including major incumbent carmakers – also use corporate VC to fund start-ups to develop new technology, or to acquire concepts developed by new entrants. Whereas in the past century, most carmakers typically developed ICE technology and manufacturing through in-house R&D, investing in start-ups has now become a notable trend. This allows incumbents to bolster their own position and maintain a competitive edge in quickly evolving markets and regulatory environments.

This allows incumbents to bolster their own position and maintain a competitive edge in quickly evolving markets and regulatory environments. In 2023, however, global VC investments in clean energy start-ups fell considerably relative to 2022, and EVs and batteries were no exception. Earlystage investments (i.e. seed and series A, referring to the first rounds of financing and the earlier stages of development) in start-ups developing EV and battery technologies dropped 20% to USD 1.4 billion in 2023. Meanwhile, growth-stage investments (i.e. series B and growth equity, which refer to the later rounds of financing as start-ups increase activity) dropped 35% to USD 10.1 billion. Several important factors are contributing to this downward trend. As competition intensifies in EV and battery markets, and as incumbents ramp up their own investments and manufacturing plans, barriers to entry for new actors get higher, and so do investor perceptions of risk. The front-running start-ups that raised funds over the 2015-2020 period are now maturing and transitioning to other sources of capital, leaving fewer alternatives for newcomers – early-stage VC for electric carmakers dropped radically in 2023. Geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, high energy prices, and rising inflation and interest rates limit the availability of higher-risk capital. We also observe a cooldown following the postCovid-19 boom of 2021-2022, which was fuelled by investment restraint during the pandemic and the expectation of significant economic recovery packages afterwards. Despite the drop, investments remain far greater than in 2019, prior to the Covid19 pandemic. Start-ups developing EV charging technology attracted over USD 400 million in early-stage VC, and battery and battery component makers USD 260 million, together accounting for half of early-stage VC. There was also a surge for two- and three-wheeler start-ups, which raised USD 200 million in earlystage VC in 2023, up from below USD 100 million in previous years. While earlystage funding for electric carmakers has dried up, and in 2023 fell far short of the Global EV Outlook 2024 Trends in the electric vehicle industry PAGE | 96 IEA. CC BY 4.0. 2018-2022 rounds, investors continue to show interest in upstream and downstream segments of EV supply chains, as well as other EV types, especially if these can scale quickly. Notable deals in 2023 included Germany-based Jolt Energy’s first round of VC funding, which raised USD 160 million. The company seeks to bring its fastcharging technology to urban areas of Europe and the United States, and claims to provide 100 km of driving range in just 5 minutes. Similarly, German EV charging start-up Numbat raised USD 75 million in series A funding through the European Infrastructure Fund, as well as another USD 75 million in loans. Indian start-up Charge Zone also raised nearly USD 55 million to develop nearly 300 charging stations. Chinese electric truck maker DeepWay raised USD 110 million in series A funding to start mass production, after having raised USD 70 million in 2022 to fund R&D and early-stage manufacturing. In the 2/3W space, Benin-based start-up Spiro raised USD 60 million, Indonesian Maka Motors raised over USD 37 million and Volta Indonesia USD 35 million, Brazilian Vammo raised USD 30 million, and Indian Simple Energy India raised USD 20 million, illustrating the importance of this segment in EMDEs. In India, Evera, a provider of all-electric cab services and management, raised USD 7 million to expand operations in Delhi, and Zyngo, an operator of electric last-mile delivery fleets, raised USD 5 million. At the growth stage, battery technology developers attracted USD 5 billion, and electric carmakers USD 2.5 billion, with significant support from public investors, indicating interest from governments to help new entrants ramp up manufacturing capacity or accelerate expansion and deployment. However, growth-stage investor appetite for electric trucks and EV charging dried up relative to previous years. Notable deals include French battery maker Verkor, which raised USD 900 million in growth equity from investors including public-private EIT InnoEnergy and BPI France, and major incumbent carmaker Renault. The company also received a nearly USD 700 million grant from the French Government and another USD 650 million in debt from the European Investment Bank to develop a 16 GWh gigafactory project in Dunkirk. To support its global expansion, Swedish battery maker Northvolt raised USD 400 million from Ontario’s asset manager, USD 1.2 billion and then another USD 150 million in debt from public Canadian investors and private banks, a USD 740 million grant from the German Government, and a USD 5 billion loan from the European Investment Bank and Nordic Investment Bank.

In the electric taxi fleet space, India-based BluSmart, a start-up providing ridehailing services, raised two rounds of USD 42 million and USD 24 million in growth equity in 2023, and another USD 25 million in 2024. However, there has been fierce competition with larger taxi fleet apps and operators in the past few years in EMDEs. In 2023, for example, electric ride-sharing app Beat, owned by Free Now, withdrew from Latin America. Leading electric vehicle start-ups and venture capital investments are geographically concentrated Similarly to for other clean energy technologies, start-ups for EVs are predominantly headquartered in the United States, Europe or China. There is, however, significant variability across different EV technology areas. Over the 2018-2023 period, in cumulative terms, about 70% of the VC investments in startups developing electric cars were made in China, 20% in the United States and 10% in Europe. Meanwhile, about 95% of the VC investments in electric trucks, buses, and commercial vehicles were made in the United States. India, the only EMDE other than China that has a significant share in global VC markets, accounted for 70% of the investments in start-ups developing electric 2/3Ws. Over the 2018-2023 period, Indian EV start-ups raised USD 2.7 billion, of which over 70% was for electric 2/3Ws. Policy support has contributed to building investor appetite for the EV sector, and the high investment levels seen in 2022 and 2023 will warrant further examination in 2024 and beyond if the FAME subsidies are reduced or phased out. The investment potential in India’s EV sector is estimated at around USD 200 billion, suggesting there are still considerable opportunities ahead for Indian entrepreneurs and start-ups. With regards to batteries, start-ups based in the United States attracted most VC investments – from 30% to over 80% of global investments over the 2018-2023 period. Investments in battery makers, however, were split evenly among major VC markets, with 30% each for China, Europe and the United States. It is noticeable that battery VC remains extremely limited in historic battery-producing countries such as Japan and Korea, where technology innovation through startups is generally less common.

Investors look to new battery chemistries, recycling, and critical mineral extraction and refining technologies As VC investors look for new opportunities across EV supply chains, novel battery concepts and critical mineral extraction and refining are gaining momentum. Over the 2018-2020 period, cumulative early-stage VC flowing to battery and component makers stood around USD 430 million, nearly 75% of which was for lithium-based battery chemistries. Over the 2021-2023 period, cumulative investments for batteries not only more than tripled, to nearly USD 1.4 billion, they also diversified. Lithium chemistries accounted for just 60% of the total, while the share of emerging concepts such as metal-hydrogen, redox-flow, solid state and sodium-ion batteries rose, growing from less than 15% to more than 25%. Not all the start-ups active in the battery space today will eventually serve EV supply chains. In fact, many companies in our sample have so far announced that long-duration power storage is their primary target market. However, there are important spillover opportunities between those two closely related technology fields. For example, sodium-ion batteries can be used for both grid-level storage and EVs, and learnings in one sector can inform technology development in the other. Notable early-stage VC deals in novel battery chemistries in 2023 included rounds by Chinese WeView (USD 90 million), United States-based Noon Energy (USD 30 million) and XL Batteries (USD 10 million), and Singapore’s VFlow Tech (USD 10 million), all of which are developing redox-flow batteries.

Similarly, Inlyte Energy raised USD 8 million in seed funding, after having received at least USD 250 000 in grants from the US Department of Energy (DoE) Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy (ARPA-E) in 2022. In the battery recycling space, notable deals in 2023 included a USD 540 million round of growth equity funding to US-based Ascend Elements, a start-up that also received two grants from the DoE totalling USD 480 million in 2022. The company, which raised another USD 160 million in 2024, aims to build North America’s first cathode precursor manufacturing facility using black mass, the typical output of lithium-ion battery recycling. Chinese Tianneng New Materials raised a series A of USD 140 million, and French MECAWARE USD 40 million. As reported last year, critical minerals VC is also expanding, standing just under USD 400 million in 2023, or nearly twice as much as in 2021 or 2022. This technology field attracted under USD 75 million in cumulative VC over the 2018-2020 period. Cobalt extraction attracted nearly USD 200 million in 2023, just like in 2022. Lithium extraction and refining attracted USD 135 million, much higher than the dip of 2022 but still below the record year of 2021.

Outlook for electric mobility Scenario overview In this part of the report, we focus on pathways to electrify road transport over the period to 2035, expanding the time horizon by five years compared with previous editions of the Global EV Outlook. A scenario-based approach is used to explore the outlook for electric mobility, based on recent market trends, policy drivers and technology developments. The purpose of the scenarios is to assess plausible futures for global electric vehicle (EV) markets and their potential implications. The scenarios do not make predictions about the future. Rather, they aim to provide insights to inform decision-making by governments, companies and other stakeholders about the future of EVs. The projections in the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) and Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) consider historical data through the end of 2023, as well as stated policies and ambitions as of the end of March 2024. The Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario) is consistent with the 2023 update to the IEA Net Zero Roadmap and the World Energy Outlook 2023. Deployment of electric vehicles is projected by road transport mode and by region. Regional results are presented for the STEPS and APS, while the discussion of the projections in the NZE Scenario focuses on global results. These projections are then compared to announcements by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and battery manufacturing capacity expansion announcements. These scenario projections incorporate GDP assumptions from the International Monetary Fund and population assumptions from the United Nations. Stated Policies Scenario The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) reflects existing policies and measures, as well as firm policy ambitions and objectives that have been legislated by governments around the world. It includes current EV-related policies, regulations and investments, as well as market trends based on the expected impacts of technology developments, announced deployments and plans from industry stakeholders. The STEPS aims to hold up a mirror to the plans of policy makers and illustrate their consequences. Global EV Outlook 2024 Outlook for electric mobility PAGE | 103 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Announced Pledges Scenario The Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) assumes that all announced ambitions and targets made by governments around the world are met in full and on time. With regards to electromobility, it includes all recent major announcements of electrification targets and longer-term net zero emissions and other pledges, regardless of whether these have been anchored in legislation or in updated Nationally Determined Contributions. For example, the APS assumes that countries that have signed on to the Conference of the Parties (COP 26) declaration on accelerating the transition to 100% zero emissions cars and vans will achieve this goal, even if there are not yet policies or regulations in place to support it. In countries that have not yet made a net zero emissions pledge or set electrification targets, the APS considers"}

In countries that have not yet made a net zero emissions pledge or set electrification targets, the APS considers the same policy framework as the STEPS. Non-policy assumptions for the APS, including population and economic growth, are the same as in the STEPS. The difference between the APS and the STEPS represents the “implementation gap” that exists between the policy frameworks and measures required to achieve country ambitions and targets, and the policies and measures that have been legislated. Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario The Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario) is a normative scenario that sets out a narrow but achievable pathway for the global energy sector to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. The scenario is compatible with limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5°C with no or limited temperature overshoot, in line with reductions assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C. There are many possible paths to achieve net zero CO2 emissions globally by 2050 and many uncertainties that could affect them. The NZE Scenario is therefore a path and not the path to net zero emissions. The difference between the NZE Scenario and the APS highlights the “ambition gap” that needs to be closed to achieve the goals under the 2015 Paris Agreement.

Vehicle outlook by mode The global electric vehicle fleet is set to grow twelve-fold by 2035 under stated policies In the STEPS, the stock of EVs across all modes except for two/three-wheelers (2/3Ws),23 grows from less than 45 million in 2023 to 250 million in 2030 and reaches 525 million in 2035. As a result, in 2035, more than one in four vehicles on the road is electric. On average, the EV stock grows by 23% annually from 2023 to 2035. In the APS, the stock of EVs (excluding 2/3Ws) reaches 585 million in 2035, over 10% higher than in the STEPS, and 30% of the vehicle fleet (excluding 2/3Ws) is electric. Compared to the STEPS, the average annual growth in the EV fleet is only slightly higher, with an average 24% growth between 2023 and 2035. In the NZE Scenario, the fleet of EVs grows even more quickly, at an average annual rate of 27% to 2035, reaching 790 million (excluding 2/3Ws).

In the STEPS, EV sales (excluding 2/3Ws) reach almost 45 million in 2030 and close to 65 million in 2035, up from around 14 million in 2023. The sales share of EVs grows from around 15% in 2023 to almost 40% in 2030 and over 50% in 2035 in the STEPS.

This gap grows to 2035, given that many policies are focused on the near- to medium term, while strategy documents outlining ambitions tend to be longersighted. Further, the gap between announced ambitions and a global trajectory to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 is larger than the policy implementation gap. In the NZE Scenario, 100% of light vehicle sales, including 2/3Ws, cars and vans, are zero-emission vehicles by 2035. This compares to an EV sales share of only around 75% of 2/3Ws and 70% of LDVs in the APS. Ambition for heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs), in particular, is lagging behind the net zero by 2050 pathway. There are, however, differences by region. China, Europe and the United States, – the largest vehicle and EV markets today – all have both ambitious targets and ambitious policies to achieve those targets. This is well illustrated by the extremely small gap between electric car sales in the STEPS and in the APS in 2030. In fact, electric car sales in 2030 in the STEPS in China, Europe and the United States together reach a sales share of over 60%, close to the global electric car sales share in the NZE Scenario.

CC BY 4.0. gap between projected sales in 2030 under the STEPS, APS and NZE Scenario is larger (with less than 20% electric car sales in aggregate in the STEPS and 30% in the APS), suggesting a need to both further expand the EV industry and to share policy learnings on implementation.

Notes: 2/3W = two/three-wheeler; LDV = light-duty vehicle; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; APS = Announced Pledges Scenario; NZE = Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario. Global electric light-duty vehicle sales are set to reach 40% in 2030 and almost 55% in 2035 based on current policy settings Light-duty vehicles (LDVs), including passenger light-duty vehicles (PLDVs) and light commercial vehicles (LCVs), are expected to continue to make up the majority of EVs (excluding 2/3Ws) through 2035. This is a result of strong policy support, including light-duty vehicle fuel economy and CO2 standards, as well as the availability of EV models and, more generally, the sheer size of the LDV market. For example, over the past year, Canada and the United Kingdom implemented policies to increase zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) sales in 2030, targeting 60% and 80% of PLDVs, respectively. As a result, electric LDV sales are projected to triple to over 43 million in 2030 in the STEPS, accounting for 40% of total LDV sales. By 2035, sales reach 60 million, representing a share of almost 55%. In this scenario, the number of internal combustion engine (ICE) cars on the roads worldwide is set to decline over time as the number of electric cars grows. The stock of electric LDVs reaches about 245 million in 2030, meaning that almost one in six LDVs on the road is electric. In 2035, electric LDV stock increases to 505 million: approximately one out of three LDVs on the road. 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 2/3W LDV Bus Truck EV sales share (%) 2023 STEPS APS NZE 2/3W LDV Bus Truck Global EV Outlook 2024 Outlook for electric mobility PAGE | 107 IEA.

The fleet of electric LDVs reaches more than 565 million in 2035, representing one in three LDVs. Of these, 525 million are electric PLDVs, with only 7% being LCVs. China is set to remain the leading region for electric LDV sales in the STEPS, though its share in global sales is expected to shrink from almost 60% in 2023 to around 40% in 2030 and 2035. The relative decline in China’s global share is due in part to the United States nearly doubling its share of global electric LDV sales to around one-fifth in both 2030 and 2035, thanks to a combination of policy efforts and industry ramp-up (see below). Despite strong growth in electric LDV sales in the STEPS, Europe’s share of global sales remains broadly stable through 2035, at around 25%. Full electrification of two/three-wheelers is within reach but requires more policy support The stock of 2/3Ws is currently the most electrified among all road transport segments, with around 65 million electric 2/3Ws on the road today, representing 500 1 000 1 500 2 000 2027 2035 Million STEPS ICEV HEV EV FCEV 2027 2035 APS 2027 2035 NZE Global EV Outlook 2024 Outlook for electric mobility PAGE | 108 IEA. CC BY 4.0. about 8% of the fleet. In the STEPS, the number of electric 2/3Ws reaches 210 million by 2030 and 360 million in 2035, over one-third of the total fleet. This trend has been supported by policy measures such as purchase subsidies in countries including India and Indonesia, and targets for electrifying the 2/3W fleet, predominantly in emerging and developing economies, which represent 90% of the global conventional 2/3Ws stock today. For example, the Dominican Republic aims for 5% of the private motorcycle fleet to be electric by 2030, Pakistan targets 50% electric 2/3W sales by 2030, and Rwanda targets a 30% fleet share of electric 2/3Ws. In the APS, the stock grows to 430 million in 2035, meaning 40% of all 2/3Ws on the roads are electric. The sales share of electric 2/3Ws in 2035 reaches 60% in the STEPS and 75% in the APS. China is the front-runner, with a sales share of around 90% by 2035 in both scenarios. In the NZE Scenario, the global electric 2/3W sales share reaches close to 80% by 2030 and 100% by 2035. Getting on track with the NZE Scenario is achievable with no technological breakthroughs or major market adaptations. Given the light weight and limited daily driving distance of 2/3Ws, electrification is relatively easy and already makes economic sense on a total cost of ownership basis in many countries. However, unlike for cars, vans and HDVs, there are currently no global initiatives to reach 100% zero-emission 2/3W sales. Strengthening regulations on emissions (or even noise pollution) from 2/3Ws can play a key role in increasing the adoption of electric 2/3Ws, along with purchase subsidies to ease any barriers for lower-income households presented by higher purchase prices compared to ICE 2/3Ws. Electric buses are projected to represent 30% of buses sold globally by 2035 based on existing policies In recent years, a number of governments have announced new funding for electric and zero-emission buses. For example, the United Kingdom has launched a second iteration of its zero emission bus programme that will provide GBP 129 million (almost USD 160 million) to support deployment over the next few years. As announced in late 2023, India is targeting 50 000 electric buses on its roads by 2027. There are also longer-standing programmes, such as the Zero Emission Bus Rapid-deployment Accelerator partnership that was launched in 2019 to accelerate the deployment of zero-emission buses in major Latin American cities. Funding programmes of this kind, and heavy-duty vehicles regulations, including the European Union’s revised CO2 emission standards for HDVs and California’s Advanced Clean Fleets, are expected to increase the sales shares of electric buses. In the STEPS, electric bus sales increase fourteen-fold from 2023 levels, to about half a million in 2035, representing 30% of bus sales.

There are also ambitious targets for electrifying bus fleets, including Chile (100% zero-emission vehicle sales for public transport by 2035), Colombia (100% zeroemission bus sales by 2035), Chinese Taipei (full conversion of the urban bus fleet to electric by 2030), Ecuador (100% electric new public transport vehicles by 2025), and Israel (all new municipal buses to be electric by 2025). Further, the Philippines and Solomon Islands recently joined countries including the Dominican Republic, Nepal, Pakistan and Panama in setting specific targets for decarbonising their bus fleets.24 Perhaps the biggest push for electric buses in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) has been at the city level. Jakarta, Indonesia, aims to electrify its fleet of 10 000 buses by 2030, with the first 100 purchased in late 2023. Uzbekistan aims to purchase 300 electric buses in its capital Tashkent and in Samarkand. Buenos Aires is targeting a 50% zeroemission bus fleet by 2030, and a wider study of 32 Latin American cities expects that 25 000 electric buses will be deployed by 2030, and 55 000 by 2050. Such targets mean that in the APS, sales of electric buses in 2035 are almost 40% higher than in the STEPS, reaching almost 1 million sales. One in four buses on the road in 2035 is electric. In the NZE Scenario, electric bus sales reach significantly higher levels: by 2035, almost 90% of bus sales are electric. Trucks continue to be slowest to electrify, but country commitments could help boost progress Zero emissions vehicles could achieve total cost of ownership parity in many HDV applications this decade, including long-haul trucks, according to recent research. And the adoption of stringent emissions standards could also help to make electric options more attractive by increasing the cost of ICE buses and trucks. Nevertheless, medium- and heavy-duty trucks may prove more difficult to electrify than other segments, in part due to the size and weight of their batteries, as well as charging requirements. Recent emissions standards in the United States and European Union will support electric HDV adoption in the coming years. In the STEPS, sales increase more than 30-fold by 2035, albeit from around 54 000 in 2023. As a result, more than 20% of medium- and heavy-duty truck sales are electric in 2035. At COP 28, six countries25 joined the Global Memorandum of Understanding on Zero-Emission Medium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicles (Global MOU), bringing the total to 33 nations26 committed to reaching 100% zero-emission sales in 2040 and 30% by 2030.

CC BY 4.0. China is expected to surpass a 50% electric car sales share in the next few years The current momentum in electric car sales has led to anticipation in China that passenger new energy vehicle (NEV) sales could reach a 50% share as soon as 2025, as stated in the recent Automotive Industry Green and Low-Carbon Development Roadmap 1.0 developed under the supervision of China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. If this materialises, it would be a decade ahead of the 50% sales in 2035 target laid out in the Energy-saving and New Energy Vehicle Technology Roadmap 2.0 published just a few years ago. Moreover, it would be well above the official target of 20% new energy car sales by 2025, and would even exceed the recently announced 45% NEV sales share target for 2027. After achieving this milestone, the sales share of electric cars and vans continues to grow in the STEPS, exceeding two-thirds of total sales in 2030 and almost reaching 85% in 2035. Given that the current trend is tracking ahead of government targets, the electric LDV sales shares are the same for STEPS and APS through 2035. However, it will be critical for China to roll out public charging infrastructure in a timely manner to enable such growth. Electric LDVs are generally cost-competitive in China even at purchase, and so the phasing out of EV purchase subsidies in 2023 is unlikely to affect further growth. Announced EV battery manufacturing capacity is well above projected sales share (see below), with an eye to potential exports, and so even higher shares are theoretically achievable. China is also the global leader in terms of electric share of the 2/3W fleet, with over one-third of all 2/3Ws being electric today, and is expected to remain the leader in electric 2/3W sales in both the STEPS and APS. In the STEPS, the sales share of electric 2/3Ws reaches nearly 90% in 2035; in the APS, the share is slightly above that by 2035. China also has one of the highest stock shares of electric buses, with more than one in four buses being electric. By 2035, the sales share of electric buses increases to over 70% in both scenarios, up from 50% in 2023. While sales of electric medium- and heavy-duty trucks are significantly lower than other road modes, China held over 90% of the world’s total global electric truck stock in 2023. Electric truck sales are projected to reach a sales share of almost 50% in 2035 in both scenarios. The sales share of EVs across all road transport modes (excluding 2/3Ws) reaches around 80% in 2035 in both scenarios. Across all modes, the current market dynamics, and the policy landscape as considered in the STEPS to 2035, are sufficient to bring EV sales shares into line with China’s ambition of climate Global EV Outlook 2024 Outlook for electric mobility PAGE | 112 IEA. CC BY 4.0. neutrality by 2060, as well as with provincial electrification targets. As such, in China there is no gap between existing policy frameworks and future targets, and even more ambition is conceivable. The European Union’s HDV CO2 standards brighten the outlook for electric heavy-duty vehicles Europe remains one of the most advanced EV markets under stated policies. Last year, the United Kingdom passed the Vehicle Emissions Trading Schemes Order 2023, which mandates certain sales shares of zero-emission cars and vans, setting a target for annual ZEV sales shares for cars to increase from 22% in 2024 to 80% in 2030. Considering the policy landscape across Europe, including the UK ZEV mandate and the EU CO2 standards for cars and vans, the sales share of electric LDVs in Europe reaches nearly 60% in 2030 and 85% in 2035 in the STEPS. The ZEV sales share in 2035 does not reach 100% for a couple of reasons. First, in the United Kingdom, the annual ZEV targets for 2031-2035 have not yet been set out in the legislation and thus the 100% ZEV sales target for 2035 is not reflected in the STEPS.

First, in the United Kingdom, the annual ZEV targets for 2031-2035 have not yet been set out in the legislation and thus the 100% ZEV sales target for 2035 is not reflected in the STEPS. Secondly, the European car market includes national markets that are not covered by such strong regulations as in the European Union and the United Kingdom. Given that the European Union has legislated to the level of its climate and EV ambitions (resulting in zero-emission LDV sales reaching 100% in 2035), and since the United Kingdom has also passed legislation for zero-emission LDVs, at least through 2030, the EV sales shares in the APS are similar to in the STEPS. Electric LDVs represent over 60% of sales in 2030 and over 90% of sales in 2035 in the APS. For buses and trucks, the revised EU HDV CO2 standards drive up electric HDV sales in the STEPS. The standards will require 100% of city bus sales to be zeroemission from 2035, and other HDVs to reduce CO2 emissions by at least 45% in 2030, 65% in 2035 and 90% from 2040, compared to 2019 levels. A number of European countries also offer grants and other financial support for the purchase of electric buses and trucks. For example, the second round of Zero Emission Bus Regional Areas (ZEBRA) funding in the United Kingdom is expected to add an additional 955 zero-emission buses to the UK fleet. In the STEPS, the sales shares of electric buses and trucks reach around 65% and 35% in 2035 in Europe. Within the European Union, sales are higher, reaching shares of 80% for buses and around 50% for trucks in 2035. The APS takes into account the ambitions of the 18 European national governments who have signed the Global MOU on Zero-Emission Medium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicles, committing to reach 30% zero-emission HDV sales shares in 2030 and 100% in 2040. Other targets are also included in the APS, such as Global EV Outlook 2024 Outlook for electric mobility PAGE | 113 IEA. CC BY 4.0. the UK aim to phase out the sale of any heavy goods vehicles weighing 26 tonnes and under that are not zero emissions by 2035. As a result, in Europe in the APS, electric bus sales reach around 80% in 2035 and electric truck sales almost 45%. In Europe, the EV sales share across all modes (excluding 2/3Ws) is 85% in 2035 in the STEPS. In the APS, Europe has a combined EV sales share of over 90% in 2035 (for electric LDVs, buses and trucks), which is in line with the global trajectory in the NZE Scenario. In the United States, new emissions standards will boost electric car and truck sales Electric car sales are expected to continue growing in the United States, thanks to successive policies that are driving up adoption. The Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards for Model Years 2024-2026 Passenger Cars and Light Trucks requires fuel economy improvements that are likely to increase the share of EV sales in just the next few years. From 2026, California’s Advanced Clean Cars II regulations, which have been adopted by twelve other states and Washington DC,27 will begin to further increase zero-emission PLDV sales, with the stated aim of reaching 100% by 2035. Combined, these states represent around one-third of light-duty vehicle sales in the United States, with a significant impact on overall electric car sales and, therefore, on OEM strategy. This could create a ripple effect across the wider market, as OEMs harmonise around the regulations in order to bring down production costs through standardisation. In addition, in March 2024, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also released the final rulemaking for Multi-Pollutant Emissions Standards for Model Years 2027 and Later Light-Duty and Medium-Duty Vehicles, which it estimates could bring electric PLDV sales to around 70% of total sales in 2032. The United States is also supporting an expansion of charging infrastructure to support increased EV adoption. At the end of 2023, construction of the first EV chargers funded under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure programme had begun, with around USD 100 million already awarded to projects. There is now around USD 2.5 billion available to states to be allocated to EV charging projects (about 60% of the total programme funding). The policy landscape in the United States, combined with already-committed industry investments (see below), is boosting confidence in EV market expansion. As a result,"}

Given that such a waiver was granted for the previous Advanced Clean Cars regulation, this regulation is included in the STEPS. Note also that three states have only partially adopted the Advanced Clean Cars II regulation, keeping the ZEV sales shares targets only through 2032 without including the 100% sales target for 2035. Global EV Outlook 2024 Outlook for electric mobility PAGE | 114 IEA. CC BY 4.0. higher than the Administration’s previously announced target, and hit more than 70% in 2035. Due to the recent policy developments, the electric LDV sales in the STEPS match government ambition and thus are the same as in the APS. Funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the US EPA has awarded almost USD 2 billion to fund approximately 5 000 school bus replacements, with another USD 3 billion to be provided to 2026, as part of the Clean School Bus Program. Under stated policies, the US electric bus sales share is expected to increase from around 1% in 2023 to 35% in 2030 and 60% in 2035. With respect to trucks, 11 states, representing around one-quarter of HDV sales in the country, have adopted California’s Advanced Clean Trucks regulation, which sets ZEV sales requirements for trucks that range from 40-75% in 2035. Bringing the national standards more in line with the Californian regulation, the US EPA finalised GHG standards for HDVs for model years 2028-2032, which aims to reduce emissions from trucks and heavy buses by 25-60% in 2032 compared to 2026. In the STEPS, the electric truck sales share across the United States reaches around 50% in 2035. The United States is also a signatory of the Global MOU, which targets 30% zeroemission M/HDV sales shares by 2030 (on aggregate, across bus and truck sales) and 100% by 2040. In the APS, the US electric bus sales share reaches around 75% in 2035 and the electric truck sales share reaches almost 70% in 2035. The EV sales share across all modes (excluding 2/3Ws) reaches more than 70% in both the STEPS and the APS in 2035. Japan’s policies in support of electric vehicles remain unchanged Japan has fuel economy standards for both light- and heavy-duty vehicles, and offers purchase subsidies for EVs. Historically, Japan has also had a relatively high sales share of hybrid (non-plug-in) vehicles, as one way to reduce emissions from cars and improve the average fuel economy. In the STEPS, the electric LDV sales share increases from about 3% in 2023 to around 20% in 2030, and 30% in 2035. In Japan’s Green Growth Strategy, the government sets a target for 100% of new car sales to be electrified by 2035 – for which their definition includes BEVs, PHEV, FCEV and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). In the APS, which reflects this target, about 70% of LDV sales in 2035 are electric (BEV or PHEV). With respect to HDVs, electric bus sales reach about 25% in 2030 and increase to 50% in 2035 in the STEPS. In the APS, electric bus sales increase to 75% in Global EV Outlook 2024 Outlook for electric mobility PAGE | 115 IEA. CC BY 4.0. 2035 to support climate targets. However, electric medium- and heavy-duty truck sales lag behind, approaching 20% in 2035 in the STEPS and about 30% in the APS.

This may be a stopgap until the announcement of a FAME III scheme, which is expected to detail new subsidy provisions for EVs. In addition, the government’s Production Linked Incentive scheme for Automobile and Auto Components and for manufacturing of Advanced Chemistry Cell Battery Storage aims to attract investments in domestic EV and battery manufacturing. Based on the current policy landscape, electric LDVs represent one in four LDVs sold in India in 2035. The APS takes into account that India signed the COP 26 declaration to transition to 100% zero-emission LDV sales by 2040. As such, electric LDV sales in 2035 reach over 60% in the APS. India has the largest stock of two-wheelers of any country and represents almost 30% of the global stock of three-wheelers. Electrifying the 2/3W segment will therefore be important for decarbonising India’s road transport system. India has made good progress to date, and almost a quarter of the country’s three-wheelers are electric. The sales share of electric 2/3Ws increases from around 8% in 2023 to almost 60% in 2035 in the STEPS. In the APS the electric sales share reaches 70% in 2035. As announced at COP 28, India is aiming to reach a stock of 50 000 electric buses by 2027, backed by a USD 390 million fund supported by both the Indian and US governments to provide loans to expand electric bus manufacturing. In both the STEPS and the APS, electric bus sales shares increase to about 35% in 2030 and 60% in 2035. Electric truck sales remain low in both scenarios to 2035, at under 10%. Across all modes (including 2/3Ws), the EV sales share in India is about 50% in 2035 in the STEPS (and closer to 25% if 2/3Ws are excluded). In the APS, EV sales shares in India scale up to over 65% in 2035 across all road vehicle modes (and to almost 60% excluding 2/3Ws). Global EV Outlook 2024 Outlook for electric mobility PAGE | 116 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Many emerging and developing economies set their sights on electrification of two- and three-wheelers and public transport Each year, more and more countries around the world are setting out a clear vision or targets for electromobility. However, in emerging and developing economies, in particular, adoption of EVs can be hindered by limited funding available for fiscal incentives and other measures to overcome purchase price hurdles. Importantly, there are still some 750 million people without access to electricity, mainly in subSaharan Africa, and others with grid reliability issues, which also affects the prospects for charging EVs. However, efforts are being made to support governments in EMDEs to advance deployment of EVs, such as through the Global Electric Mobility Programme, as well as proposed reforms that could improve financing options from Multilateral Development Banks. In many EMDEs, the main targets of vehicle electrification initiatives are 2/3Ws and public transport. In Colombia, for example, there has been a major focus on electrifying mass transportation systems (buses), cargo vehicles and taxis. Targets for electric 2/3Ws have been set in countries as diverse as Cambodia, Morocco and the Dominican Republic. In the STEPS, the average EV sales share across regions and countries outside of those described in the preceding sections is about 45% for 2/3Ws, 20% for buses, 18% for LDVs and 3% for trucks in 2035. In the APS, sales across these other regions reach 65% of 2/3Ws, 40% of LDVs, 30% of buses and 10% of trucks. The countries that have adopted EV-related policies and set ambitions tend to have higher EV sales shares than these averages. In particular, Canada tends to align with the most ambitious standards in North America. In December 2023, Canada amended its GHG regulations to include new requirements to increase the availability of zero-emission passenger cars and light trucks, targeting at least 20% zero-emission vehicle sales by 2026, at least 60% by 2030 and 100% zeroemission vehicle sales by 2035.

The industry outlook The ten largest carmakers are set to sell over 20 million electric cars in 2030, exceeding current policy targets As of 2023, the ten largest global automakers all have established clear electrification targets. Together, these automakers sold over 40 million cars in 2023, representing about 55% of global sales. Although some manufacturers have missed or postponed near-term targets – often pointing to underwhelming consumer demand – they have not scaled back their longer-term ambitions. If each company in the top ten meets their target, over 20 million new electric cars could be sold in 2030. Notable examples include BMW’s target of 50% of deliveries in 2030 to be BEVs; Toyota’s 3.5 million BEV sales target in 2030; Stellantis’s 5 million BEV sales target in 2030; and GM’s target of a global EV manufacturing capacity of 2 million per year by 2025. In addition, Tesla is targeting production of 20 million electric cars in 2030, which – combined with the targets of the top ten – would be roughly equivalent to the projected sales in the STEPS in that year. In total, more than 20 OEMs, together representing over 90% of car sales in 2023, have set some sort of target for future EV deployment. The global electric car sales envisaged in announcements by manufacturers have increased by several percentage points based on developments over the past year. If all manufacturers’ targets on vehicle electrification are combined, between 42% and 58% of car sales in 2030 could be electric. This range encompasses the sales share for cars in the STEPS (almost 45%) and the share implied by government ambitions in the APS (almost 50%). Regional examples include:  In China, major carmakers, including incumbents, have increased their electrification ambitions. For example, SAIC and Geely are targeting 50% NEV sales by 2025.  In Europe, more ambitious targets announced by majors such as Volkswagen, Ampere (a spin-out of Renault), Nissan and Suzuki have increased the overall OEM electrification targets relative to last year’s range. For example, Volkswagen increased its BEV delivery target from 70% to 80% by 2030. On the other hand, Mercedes-Benz has delayed its goal of 50% electrified car sales by 5 years, to 2030.  In the United States, both Ford and GM missed their 2023 targets or abandoned those for 2024, citing profitability concerns, though they are maintaining longerterm targets. Ford missed its targeted manufacturing rate of 600 000 EVs per year in 2023, but now aims to achieve that in 2024. GM had previously planned to manufacture 400 000 electric cars in North America by mid-2024, but has now Global EV Outlook 2024 Outlook for electric mobility PAGE | 118 IEA. CC BY 4.0. dropped that target, and yet has retained a US manufacturing capacity target of 1 million electric cars by 2025. Meanwhile, Volkswagen increased their BEV delivery target in the United States from 50% to 55% by 2030. As a result of missed near-term targets but robust longer-term ambition, the outlook for the United States based on OEM targets has remained stable over the past year.  In Japan too, new announcements have increased the aggregate OEM target range. Suzuki aims to reach 20% BEV sales in 2030. Subaru announced a new and more ambitious target of 50% BEV sales out of a total of 1.2 million car sales in 2030, with a production capacity of 400 000 BEVs in Japan and even a new BEV production line in the United States before 2030. Subaru plans to introduce a total of 8 new BEV models, and to sell 400 000 BEVs in the United States by 2028.  In India, Tata is targeting a 50% EV sales share by 2030 and net zero GHG emissions by 2045.

For example, ICE phase-outs have been announced by Jaguar from 2025, Mini and Rolls-Royce from the beginning of the 2030s, Lexus from 2035, Land Rover from 2036, and Honda from 2040. 28 Combined, these brands represented over 5% of global car sales in 2023. Even more automakers have pledged to phase out ICE vehicle sales in the European market specifically, including include Ford, Volkswagen, Stellantis, Lancia, Renault and Nissan. Policy is boosting investment in manufacturing capacity, building confidence for a rapid electrification pathway Battery and EV manufacturers have faced new challenges and opportunities as major markets including the United States and the European Union introduced new industrial policies. Domestic content requirements introduced by these policies have supported the expansion plans of major battery and EV manufacturers, with billions in investments already committed as of early 2024. Worldwide, reported investment announcements from 2022 and 2023 alone exceed USD 275 billion in EVs and USD 195 billion in batteries, with around USD 190 billion of the total already committed. The level of investments observed in the past 2 years boosts confidence in the electrification of road transport. In China, committed battery manufacturing capacity is well above what is needed to supply domestic electric car sales in 2030. In fact, just two-thirds of the alreadycommitted battery cell manufacturing capacity would be sufficient to cover 100% of electric car sales in China in 2030. This excess capacity, which is today driving 28 Mercedez-Benz had previously announced the end of ICE car sales this decade but has recently delayed that target. Global EV Outlook 2024 Outlook for electric mobility PAGE | 120 IEA. CC BY 4.0. down margins, implies that battery producers are banking on export markets, at least in part. This will bring both opportunities and challenges. Countries that have electrification targets but lack sufficient battery manufacturing capacity could reach these targets through imports from China, whereas companies outside of China will see increased competition from the arrival of Chinese manufacturers. Governments will seek to find the right balance between supporting local producers at the same time as ensuring consumers can benefit from the low prices offered by Chinese manufacturers, which would accelerate road electrification. In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) revised the requirements for the Clean Vehicle Tax Credit. Now, to qualify for the tax credit of up to USD 7 500, vehicle assembly must take place in North America and meet the critical minerals and battery components requirements. 29 In December 2023, guidance was released defining the \"Foreign Entities of Concern” as part of the tax credit exclusions: vehicles with batteries containing components manufactured or assembled by a foreign entity of concern (which includes China) cannot qualify for the tax credit. The number of eligible electric car models has therefore fallen from more than 40 in the second half of 2023 to around 27 from the beginning of January 2024.30 In 2025, restrictions may be expanded such that EVs cannot qualify if their batteries contain any critical minerals that were extracted, processed, or recycled by a foreign entity of concern. From September 2022 to the end of 2023, after the IRA was signed into law, investments of more than USD 60 billion were announced to support the EV industry, in EV manufacturing, charging and batteries"}

From September 2022 to the end of 2023, after the IRA was signed into law, investments of more than USD 60 billion were announced to support the EV industry, in EV manufacturing, charging and batteries in the United States.31 The vast majority – about 80% – of these investments are for batteries; with just around USD 5 billion announced for EVs, though there are, of course, strong links between battery manufacturing and EV manufacturing. For example, in February 2024, Volkswagen-backed Scout Motors started building a USD 2 billion electric sports utility vehicle (SUV) manufacturing plant in South Carolina. In mid-2023, BMW broke ground on their high-voltage battery manufacturing plant (USD 700 million) to supply batteries for their announced EV production lines (USD 1 billion) in South Carolina. Hyundai-Kia, which in 2023 overtook GM and Ford in terms of electric car sales share, plans to manufacture EVs in the state of Georgia by October 2024 to qualify for IRA benefits. Announced battery manufacturing expansions in the United States, in part resulting from signals sent by the IRA, would be more than enough to satisfy carmaker electrification targets and government ambitions in 2030. Of course, the 29 The critical minerals requirement refers to minimum percentages of critical mineral extraction or processing (by values) in the United States or in a country which has a free trade agreement with the United States. The battery component requirement refers to minimum percentages of battery component manufacturing or assembly (by value) that takes place in North America. 30 Based on model trim eligibility from the US government website. 31 Another USD 5 billion has been invested in battery manufacturing in Canada since the IRA was passed. Global EV Outlook 2024 Outlook for electric mobility PAGE | 121 IEA. CC BY 4.0. announced investments in battery manufacturing will first need to be realised, and we estimate that it would require around USD 100 billion in capital expenditures32 to reach the level of battery manufacturing capacity necessary to meet demand for electric cars in 2030 in the APS. According to the Clean Investment Monitor, actual expenditures in EV battery manufacturing from 2020 to 2023 totalled around USD 45 billion. Around 45% of the capital expenditure (CAPEX) needed for battery manufacturing has therefore already been spent. In the European Union, the Net Zero Industry Act and the subsequent relaxing of state aid rules in March 2023 are boosting public support for road transport electrification. For example, in January 2024, Swedish battery maker Northvolt received approval for EUR 700 million in direct grant and EUR 200 million in guarantee from Germany, which was described as “proportionate and limited to the minimum necessary to trigger the investment in Europe”. Northvolt’s project is expected to require a total investment of EUR 4.5 billion, creating 3 000 jobs and starting battery manufacturing in 2026. The company also secured a USD 5 billion green loan – touted as the largest green loan in Europe to date – with the support of European and Korean banks and export credit agencies. The loan will enable further expansion for the production of cathodes, cell manufacturing and a recycling plant in northern Sweden. As of 2024, the market signals provided by the Net Zero Industry Act have been sufficient to attract enough committed investments in battery manufacturing capacity in the European Union to satisfy government electrification targets out to 2030. Across the whole of Europe, committed investments come close to meeting these targets. While investments that are already committed today tend to be more heavily geared towards battery than to EV manufacturing, it is important to note that battery manufacturing and EV expansion plans typically go hand in hand, often being situated close to demand centres to create integrated supply chains. This close collaboration is important in order to deliver on targets, avoid bottlenecks and decrease costs. In addition, in the event that committed EV battery manufacturing capacity outpaces demand from EV manufacturers, it is unlikely that it would find alternative outlets, as other key battery markets such as consumer electronics are already well supplied and have different technical specifications. Failure to deliver on EV manufacturing capacity and sales therefore creates a risk of massive sunk investment in battery manufacturing, if manufacturers are unable to export significant quantities. 32 CAPEX of 2023 USD 107 million per GWh of battery manufacturing capacity is assumed.

Committed refers to plants that have reached a final investment decision and are starting or have already started construction works. Battery manufacturing capacity refers to the mobility sector only and assumes utilisation factors of 85%. Sources: IEA analysis based on companies announcements and data from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, Bloomberg New Energy Finance and EV Volumes. For example, in Europe, Volkswagen benefits from close co-operation with two of the biggest regional battery manufacturers, LG Energy Solutions and Samsung, which together provide batteries for 95% of Volkswagen’s European electric car sales. In China, on the other hand, Volkswagen works with CATL, which provides almost all the batteries for its Chinese electric car sales. Similarly, Tesla works with Panasonic’s Nevada plant in the United States, but with CATL and LG Energy Solutions in China. When considering expansion plans, battery manufacturers often seek to bring operations closer to the production facilities of partner OEMs. CATL is currently developing manufacturing facilities in Hungary to provide regional car makers like Stellantis, which sources nearly 50% of its European EV batteries from CATL and the other half from LG and Samsung SDI. A similar trend is already observable outside of the biggest EV markets, such as in Türkiye, where the Turkish brand Togg and Farasis Energy created a joint venture in April 2023. During 2023 the Togg T10X model reached almost 20 000 registrations in Türkiye, becoming the fourth most sold car model in November 2023. Continued co-operation between EV and battery makers is expected to continue to support road transport electrification into the future. As of early 2024, half of the committed battery manufacturing capacity in the United States will be delivered by joint ventures between an EV and a battery manufacturer (e.g. LG-GM, LG0% 50% 100% 150% 200% China Europe United States Japan Global Range of OEM declarations Domestic battery manufacturing capacity: STEPS APS Existing and committed All announcements Global EV Outlook 2024 Outlook for electric mobility PAGE | 123 IEA.

Many similar joint ventures are seen in Europe (e.g. Northvolt-Volvo, Envision-Nissan). There are even joint ventures for battery components, such as between Volkswagen and Umicore to produce battery cathodes. Globally, on the basis of industry announcements, committed battery manufacturing capacity in 2030 would be sufficient to support the electric car sales share reaching more than 55%, higher than the sales shares implied by automaker targets and both the STEPS and APS projections. In fact, the committed and existing battery manufacturing capacity would meet over 90% of the EV battery demand in the NZE Scenario in 2030. Heavy-duty original equipment manufacturers are most ambitious in the European market, driven by proposed CO2 standards A few new announcements on zero-emission vehicle strategies have been seen in the HDV market, such as the agreement signed by Hino Motors Sales USA that could result in the delivery of up to 10 000 electric trucks by 2030. For the United States, the range of OEM targets in 2030 encompasses the zero-emission vehicle sales shares in the STEPS (around 20%). Chinese OEM Foton has also announced a target of 50% NEV sales by 2030. Similarly, BAIC Trucks also plans to sell 50% new energy trucks by 2030 and 80% by 2035. On aggregate, OEM targets would imply that zero-emission truck sales represent 13-32% of Chinese truck sales in 2030.

The figure compares OEM targets for heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) (which for some OEMs include buses) relative to IEA projections for zero-emission medium- and heavy-duty truck sales (including fuel cell electric vehicles). Since annual sales of trucks substantially outnumber sales of buses, achieving HDV targets will require selling zero-emission trucks, which is currently more challenging than selling electric buses.

CC BY 4.0. 8. Outlook for electric vehicle charging infrastructure Light-duty vehicle charging Public charging could increase sixfold by 2035, helping mass-market consumers switch to electric Large-scale adoption of EVs hinges on the simultaneous roll-out of accessible and affordable charging. The early adopters of electric cars have tended to live in single-family detached homes with affordable and convenient access to home charging. As a result, most charging to date has been private (at home and other private locations). At the same time, public chargers have tended to be installed in urban areas, where utilisation rates are likely to be higher. Looking forward, however, chargers must also be installed outside of urban areas to enable continued adoption beyond cities and suburbs. In a 2021 survey of EV drivers in the United Kingdom, over 90% of the respondents reported having access to home chargers, whereas a 2023 study showed that only 55% of Indian consumers had such access. The build-out of charging in workplaces and publicly accessible areas will be key for increasing adoption among groups without access to home charging. Charging speed – slow or fast – is also an important consideration for consumers looking to switch to electric, especially when considering a vehicle for long journeys. Charging services should also be easy to use, reliable and transparently priced. Further, ensuring interoperability is important when making investments in charging infrastructure and services, so that a wide customer base is able to benefit. In the STEPS and APS, the global number of public charging points exceeds 15 million by 2030, up four-fold compared to the almost 4 million operating in 2023. By 2035, this number reaches almost 25 million in the APS, a sixfold increase relative to 2023. Among today’s major EV markets, China is where the population’s access to home charging is most limited and where public charging has been most widely rolled out as a result. China accounted for 70% of global public LDV charging in 2023 and is expected to remain a leader with a similar share in 2035 in the STEPS. While the current availability of public chargers in China already appears to be above the global average (<10 electric LDVs per public charging point), the government recently issued new guidelines for deploying high-quality charging Global EV Outlook 2024 Outlook for electric vehicle charging infrastructure PAGE | 126 IEA.

In Europe, the stock of public LDV chargers increases to around 2.7 million in 2035 in both the STEPS and APS, up from about 730 000 in 2023. In both scenarios, roughly 80% of the European public charging stock is in the European Union, or around 2.3 million chargers in 2035. Policies focused on charging infrastructure play an important role in increasing the number of charging points per EV. Specifically, the EU Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR) requires member states to ensure publicly accessible charging stations offer in aggregate at least 1.3 kW of power output per BEV and 0.8 kW per PHEV. The capacity requirements can be relaxed once 15% battery electric stock share has been reached. In the APS, the average charging capacity per EV is close to 1 kW, despite over 80% of electric LDVs being battery electric, given that battery electric LDVs reach a 30% stock share.

The United Kingdom expects to install at least 300 000 public chargers by 2030. In the APS, the roll-out of public chargers is slightly slower but maintains adequate coverage in terms of charging capacity available, with the stock reaching only 220 000 in 2030, with 1.2 kW of charging capacity per electric LDV available, and reaching 300 000 5 years later in 2035. Considering the stock of electric LDVs approaches 20 million in 2035 in the APS, this corresponds to over 60 electric LDVs per public charging point, up from around 30 in 2023.

In the United States, the government has announced nearly USD 50 million to subsidise projects that aim to expand access to convenient charging, in line with its objective of building a national network of 500 000 public EV charging ports by 2030. In the APS, the number of public chargers reaches 900 000 in 2030 and 1.7 million in 2035, many of which will likely be funded by private investment and go beyond highway corridors.

Additionally, in March 2023, the Ministry of Heavy Industries announced financial aid for the development of charging infrastructure. In the APS, the ratio of electric LDVs per public charging point remains low, like in China, with the number of charging points projected to reach almost 2 million by 2035 in order to supply around 25 million electric LDVs. Recommendations for EV charging concessions to implement the EU Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation Following the formal adoption of the EU AFIR in 2023, EU member states are now implementing the regulation through the public and private entities that operate European motorway networks. This process is helping to build up the knowledge base on how to ensure that reliable charging points are deployed quickly and effectively through competitive tendering, thereby fostering the emerging market for EV charging infrastructure. Key learnings include: 1 – Collect information on state-of-the-art technologies and designs prior to issuing the tender Carrying out a market consultation with charging point operators (CPOs) ahead of publishing a tender can help to ensure that the tenders are designed to encourage bids that follow best practices and use the latest technologies in this emerging sector. 2 – Include station design and reliability in the evaluation criteria of a tender Tender evaluations should consider other criteria alongside rent (i.e. the amount that the CPO pays to operate the station), to ensure that CPOs also score highly on other factors relevant to the offer to customers. Tenders should include criteria to ensure that EV charging stations are well designed and easily accessible. This includes making sure that charging stations have sufficient space to accommodate EVs of different sizes, including HDVs, camper vans and vehicles with caravans, as well as users with limited mobility, so that drivers are not required to perform potentially dangerous manoeuvres. Criteria can also be designed to ensure that chargers can service the newest generation of BEVs, as well as older models, and that sites have the potential to expand as the EV market increases. Global EV Outlook 2024 Outlook for electric vehicle charging infrastructure PAGE | 129 IEA. CC BY 4.0. For successful long-term operation and ensuring EV drivers are not dissuaded, CPOs need to be held accountable for providing a reliable service. Competitive tenders should set criteria for quality, with penalties for those that do not meet required standards, for example 99% uptime and regular charger maintenance. Further, selection criteria can be used to ensure chargers are smart-ready, able to share data within the charging ecosystem, provide fair and transparent pricing, and meet interoperability obligations. 3 – Bundle more and less desirable sites to ensure full coverage Charging stations located at sites with higher traffic often have a higher utilisation rate and thus are more profitable than those with lower traffic. In order to prevent CPOs from only bidding on the most desirable locations, tenders can bundle the motorway locations into several “lots” composed of higher- and lower-traffic sites. 4 – Ensure tender terms provide a viable business case Given that the EV market is still relatively nascent, many EV charging stations will not be profitable for a number of years. ChargeUp Europe, an industry association, recommends that a contract duration of at least 15 years is necessary for CPOs to recover initial investments and for sites to become profitable. In general, the lower the current EV stock share, the longer the tender terms should be for CPOs to feel confident in the business proposition. Further, to best enable CPOs to assess the business case for a tender, only one CPO should be selected to serve each service area, as is the case with conventional petrol stations. The presence of multiple CPOs makes it very difficult to predict revenues given low EV penetration rates. Different CPOs could be selected on consecutive service areas to provide greater customer choice and market competition. Local monopolies should be avoided. 5 – Prepare grid connections Establishing a grid connection can be a lengthy, complex process, which can delay development of charging stations.

Governments can also set requirements for grid operators to respond to requests within a set time and ensure there are no conflicts of interest between grid operators and parties requesting grid connections. In countries where grid operators also operate as CPOs, they can be in direct competition with operators requesting connections.

The share of public charging is expected to grow in the next decade, though most charging will still take place at home Statistics on the availability of home chargers are scattered, and our analysis therefore assumes that access to home charging covers 50-80% of the electric LDV fleet, based on various surveys, depending on the share of population residing in dense urban areas.33 We estimate that globally there were 27 million home chargers in operation in 2023, or 150 GW of charging capacity and 1.6 electric LDVs per home charger. The stock grows more than tenfold by 2035 in the STEPS to reach over 270 million. In the APS, the home charger stock reaches around 300 million in 2035. The stock of other private chargers increases up to 14-fold by 2035 in the APS, while public chargers increase sixfold. In both scenarios, the charging capacity offered by public chargers in 2035 is higher than that offered by private chargers outside of homes. In total, there are an estimated 1.2 electric LDVs per charging point, including public and private, 2035 in the APS, up from just over 1 in 2023. Even with access to home charging, EV owners rely to some extent on public charging. As EV adoption broadens, the share of charging from other private or public charging stations (in terms of electricity delivered to vehicles) is expected to grow over time. By 2035, the share of electricity coming from chargers other than home chargers reaches almost 45%, compared to less than 35% in 2023.

CC BY 4.0. Heavy-duty vehicle charging As more and more buses and trucks are electrified, charging capacity is set to grow twenty-fold by 2035 For commercial vehicle operators, similarly to owners of personal EVs, overnight charging of electric HDVs at depots offers a convenient way to charge stationary vehicles. Charging overnight also has the benefit of being able to charge at relatively low power rates given the amount of time available. This kind of charging strategy requires a close to one-to-one ratio of depot charger per electric HDV. In the near term, it is expected that electrification of HDVs will proceed most quickly for segments with relatively short (under 200 km/day), predictable daily routes, such as city buses, urban and even some regional delivery services. Overnight depot charging could likely meet most of the needs of these fleets. In addition, there will also be a role for opportunity chargers. Opportunity chargers can be at the end of a bus line or at a truck loading dock, where vehicles can take advantage of waiting time to charge without disrupting typical operations. Opportunity chargers also include public chargers along motorways that allow for en-route charging. For some HDVs, such as intercity buses and long-haul trucks, en-route fast charging may be needed to supplement depot charging in order to enable long-distance driving. While these segments could be slower to electrify, their relatively high share of activity today – and thus emissions – mean they will be important to decarbonise.

However, the current analysis of charger needs does not take into account non-wired charging options, as the future role of these alternative technologies remains uncertain.

Heavy-duty vehicle charger stock and capacity in the Stated Policies and Announced Pledges Scenarios, 2023-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Notes: STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; APS = Announced Pledges Scenario. Charger stock in 2023 is estimated based on the number of electric buses and trucks. In the STEPS, over 99% of HDV chargers are depot chargers in 2030, though about 10% of electricity is provided by opportunity chargers. By 2035, there is greater deployment and utilisation of opportunity chargers, with the stock more than tripling compared to 2030 to reach 100 000 in 2035. In total, the installed capacity of chargers for HDVs reaches 2 000 GW in 2035 in the APS. For reference, the installed global renewable electricity capacity in 2022 was around 3 600 GW. Despite the average capacity of an opportunity charger being assumed to be around four times as high as a depot charger (especially considering the role of MW-scale charging), less than 5% of the total installed capacity for heavy-duty chargers in 2035 is from opportunity chargers. Policy has an important role to play in fostering infrastructure roll-out. The EU AFIR, for example, includes requirements for coverage of HDV charging points with a power output of at least 350 kW along TEN-T Network by the end of 2025. In March 2024, the United States released the National Zero-Emission Freight Corridor Strategy, which aims to guide infrastructure deployment, catalyse public and private investment; and support utility and regulatory planning and action at local, state and regional levels. As of the end of 2023, cumulative private investment in medium- and heavy-duty vehicle charging infrastructure in the United States amounted to USD 4.2 billion.

Special focus: examining the impacts of ramping up heavy-duty charging on power grids A key challenge for rolling out charging infrastructure is ensuring that it can provide secure, low-emissions and affordable electricity. Decision makers will need to assess the impacts of HDV charging on the expansion and operation of power systems, and to plan accordingly. In this section, we explore the implications of different HDV charging strategies for power systems, through an analysis at the bulk power system level for three regions (China, the European Union and the United States) and a case study of a local high-voltage grid. We also discuss some strategies and technologies to mitigate the impacts of HDV charging on power grids. EV charging creates both challenges and opportunities for electricity systems. Beyond local issues such as variations in power quality (e.g. harmonic distortion), EV charging can have an impact on electricity systems, mainly via demand-supply imbalances, either locally (e.g. by causing grid congestion) or – if there is a large enough fleet – at the system level. The electricity system impacts of EV charging can be principally understood by a combination of three dimensions: the when (at what time and for how long), the where (in which location of the grid), and the how much (the charging power that the vehicle is using).

On the other hand, charging could become a beneficial opportunity if it is possible to charge the fleet at a different time of the day, when there is less congestion or greater renewable power availability, or if it is possible to charge in a different location. This analysis is based on four cases that only differ with regards to the charging location and the power availability. There is no difference in technical parameters such as battery size or average daily mileage. All these cases represent feasible ways of meeting heavy-duty truck charging needs with different charging location options.  Case 1. Heavy-duty trucks charge exclusively overnight at the depot, with a nominal capacity of 50 kW per charging point.  Case 2. There is a 50/50 preference between charging overnight at the depot and charging at the truck loading dock, with a capacity of 150 kW in the latter destination. Global EV Outlook 2024 Outlook for electric vehicle charging infrastructure PAGE | 134 IEA. CC BY 4.0. En-route charging is studied under two different cases:  Case 3 - 350kW. There is a 50/50 preference between charging at the depot overnight and stopping for around 45 minutes in the afternoon at a public charging spot (e.g. highway) where 350 kW fast chargers are available.34  Case 3 - 1 MW. With the same behavioural profile, charging power stands at 1 MW instead of 350 kW. These cases are similar to the charging taxonomy described in a recent European Network of Transmission System Operators (ENTSO-E) study on the impacts of heavy-duty EV charging on the power system.

Notes: Case 1 represents charging overnight at a depot; Case 2 represents charging during the day at a loading dock in addition to overnight charging; Cases 3 represent en-route fast charging, for example along highways, in addition to overnight charging, with power ratings of either 350 kW or 1 MW. The values plotted are based on a simulation of 1 000 trucks over 24 hours using the IEA Electric Vehicle Charging and Grid Integration Tool. Fleet behaviour is represented by assuming that vehicles arrive, stay and depart at different times because of the underlying probabilistic distribution, resulting in a charging profile that is not fully simultaneous for all vehicles in the fleet. As part of the simulation inputs, it was assumed that each truck has a battery capacity of 500 kWh, consumes 1.4 kWh/km and travels 300 +/- 50 km per day. 34 This case reflects EU regulations that require drivers to take a break of at least 45 minutes every 4.5 hours. 6 18 Hour Depot Destination (loading dock) En route 20 60 100 6 18 MW Hour 6 18 Hour Case 1 Case 2 Case 3 - 1 MW 20 60 100 6 18 MW Hour Case 3 - 350 kW Global EV Outlook 2024 Outlook for electric vehicle charging infrastructure PAGE | 135 IEA.

Across regions, the largest impacts by 2035 in the APS are in the European Union and the United States, where demand from electric trucks accounts for around 3% of total electricity demand. In China, truck charging has less of an impact on total electricity demand profiles in the APS (less than 1% by 2035), as other sectors such as industry play a much larger role.

Overnight charging at truck depots increases night-time demand and limits daily load variations, smoothing the truck charging load curve. Opportunity charging (at the loading dock) or en-route charging shifts power demand to the daytime, potentially creating new peaks in consumption. MW-scale chargers reduce charging times, producing high demand spikes that can be challenging for local grids. Fast chargers reinforce afternoon peaks, potentially overtaking the typical evening peak from residential consumers and passenger car charging. Different charging approaches also lead to different results in terms of how well they support the integration of renewables. Daytime charging can more directly support solar PV integration, as loading dock or en-route charging increases demand between midday and the afternoon, when solar PV production is high, and electricity prices are potentially low. Increasing daytime power demand via charging could facilitate balancing supply and demand at the system level, and reduce the need for measures such as curtailment to manage excesses in solar PV output. Daytime charging can also be directly coupled with solar through the installation of solar panels on the roofs of charging depots. In contrast, while overnight charging at truck depots may (at times) coincide with high wind output, and could potentially benefit users if electricity prices are low at night, it does not directly contribute to solar PV integration.

Fast charging during the day could reduce the need for power system flexibility in the evening Fast daytime charging of electric heavy-duty trucks could reduce the need for electricity system flexibility35 in the early evening – typically the most challenging period of the day in terms of power system operation. In the early evening, demand from several end uses tends to increase quickly, precisely when solar PV supply declines at sunset. As a result, the net load (i.e. total demand minus generation from solar PV and wind) ramps up, requiring higher short-duration flexibility – a need that will become all the more important as the share of solar PV increases in the overall system. This flexibility can be met by several sources, including dispatchable generation units, storage, or demand response. Additional flexibility needs can lead to operational challenges and higher costs, as maintaining a precise balance of electricity supply and demand requires either the use of power plants that have ramp-up constraints and start-up costs, or other measures that each have their own limitations (such as the state of charge of energy storage) and costs.

In the APS, electric truck charging does not become a significant contributor to early-evening peak demand in China, the European Union nor the United States by 2035.

Note: The early evening is considered to be a three-hour period starting at 17:00. MW-scale truck charging could lead to notable hikes in the utilisation rates of local grids Drawing from these case studies of HDV charging patterns, grid simulation techniques can be used to examine the possible impacts on the grid, considering the time and location of various loads and generation units. The impacts on local grids will vary greatly depending on the particularities of each system. However, our analysis, based on a simulated local high-voltage grid, suggests that greater use of daytime fast charging for heavy trucks can result in significantly higher utilisation rates of power lines. This highlights the need for anticipatory grid investment planning, and for consideration of available grid-hosting capacities to deploy and operate HDV charging stations without putting security and affordability at risk. In our analysis, fast daytime charging, particularly MW-scale charging, would be the main driver of investments in the grid (although overnight charging may also necessitate grid upgrades). With higher shares of EVs in the fleet, fast daytime charging can induce much higher average system-utilisation rates of power lines, which suggests that targeted improvements may be needed.

However, higher average system-utilisation rates point to a growing, systemic need for anticipatory investments in either grid expansion or upgrade, non-wire alternatives such as demand management or stationary batteries, or a combination of measures.

CC BY 4.0. Smart charging will be an essential tool for managing the impacts of charging on the electricity grid. Not only can it help with co-ordinating supply and demand at the system level, but it can also help send adequate locational signals that ensure that local constraints are respected, and that charging takes place during the best moments for the system. In the specific case of HDVs, smart charging schemes at overnight depots can help ensure that the flexibility opportunity provided by the long charging window can be exploited as much as possible. Similarly, smart charging can incentivise drivers at loading docks or en-route chargers to either maximise or minimise their use of the charger, leaving space to complete the charge later at the depot if needed. Several other measures can reduce the impacts of fast charging, and even provide additional grid services. While grid upgrades will be necessary in many cases, other solutions such as electric road systems can be of great help. Measures such as battery swapping can also reduce strain on grids by charging replacement batteries over longer timeframes, reducing the peak power needs. Alternatively, co-located stationary batteries and/or renewable generators can enable the CPO to meet some of their own charging needs. This can combine the advantages of intra-day charging using solar energy, which can be used to charge the stationary batteries, and night discharge to reduce power grid load, where trucks can be charged using the stationary batteries. Additionally, these assets could be used to provide grid services such as energy arbitrage or frequency regulation (provided that the regulatory framework supports it), which can enhance the profitability of such projects. The business cases of each of these measures must be carefully assessed to decide which solution (or set of solutions) could be cheapest for each charging station and for the system. Co-ordinated, anticipatory measures will be essential to balance the bulk power system benefits of fast charging with local grid impacts This analysis highlights the need to consider multiple aspects for the smooth rollout of HDV charging infrastructure, in particular, but also all charging infrastructure in general, including:  Co-ordinated charging infrastructure development: collaborative planning between stakeholders such as policy makers, utilities, system fleet managers and CPOs can optimise system development and reduce costs, particularly as fast charging could create a need for network upgrades in different segments of the grid.  Data-gathering: A careful study of the driving patterns of heavy-duty trucks will be essential to inform the best possible roll-out and operation of HDV charging infrastructure. For example, a recent study used real-world truck stop data to assess the attributes of potential charging locations in Germany, highlighting the Global EV Outlook 2024 Outlook for electric vehicle charging infrastructure PAGE | 141 IEA. CC BY 4.0. attractiveness of industrial areas along the TEN-T. This can help build understanding not only of charging needs, but also the opportunities for flexibility in charging behaviour.  Strategic and integrated power grid planning: as grid upgrades and expansion can have long lead times, anticipatory planning using authoritative scenarios that also consider the needs of other sectors will be crucial to avoid power grids becoming a bottleneck for the adequate deployment and operation of charging infrastructure. Grid capacities must be considered when choosing a location and designing the installed capacity of chargers.

This can also help avoid unintended events like ‘herd’ behaviour – such as when all vehicles are charged at night, causing significant grid impacts. Market design (such as timevarying tariffs) to signal where and when it is best to charge to minimise system impacts, the readiness of smart charging infrastructure, and data-sharing between stakeholders, will be vital enablers.  Local solutions for managing local challenges: deploying technologies such as stationary batteries in charging stations, battery swapping, or on-site renewable power plants can reduce stress on the grids and help integrate fast charging, thereby benefiting users. Some of these options can also provide additional services to the power system beyond demand management. In many cases, these solutions have the additional advantage of shorter deployment lead times than grid expansions, and may also be cheaper overall. Global EV Outlook 2024 Outlook for battery and energy demand PAGE | 142 IEA. CC BY 4.0. 9. Outlook for battery and energy demand Battery demand Battery demand for electric vehicles jumps tenfold in ten years in a net zero pathway As EV sales continue to increase in today’s major markets in China, Europe and the United States, as well as expanding across more countries, demand for EV batteries is also set to grow quickly. In the STEPS, EV battery demand grows fourand-a-half times by 2030, and almost seven times by 2035 compared to 2023. In the APS and the NZE Scenario, demand is significantly higher, multiplied by five and seven times in 2030 and nine and twelve times in 2035, respectively. To put this in context, in the APS in 2035, there could be as much EV battery demand per week as there was in the entire year of 2019. Cars remain the primary driver of EV battery demand, accounting for about 75% in the APS in 2035, albeit down from 90% in 2023, as battery demand from other EVs grows very quickly. In the STEPS, battery demand for EVs other than cars jumps eightfold by 2030 and fifteen-fold by 2035. In the APS, these numbers reach tenfold by 2030 and more than twenty-fold by 2035. Battery requirements differ across modes, with a 2/3W requiring a battery about 20 times smaller than a BEV, while buses and trucks require batteries that are between 2 and 5 times bigger than for a BEV. This also affects trends in different regions, given that 2/3Ws are significantly more important in emerging economies than in developed economies. As EVs increasingly reach new markets, battery demand outside of today’s major markets is set to increase. In the STEPS, China, Europe and the United States account for just under 85% of the market in 2030 and just over 80% in 2035, down from 90% today. In the APS, nearly 25% of battery demand is outside today’s major markets in 2030, particularly as a result of greater demand in India, Southeast Asia, South America, Mexico and Japan. In the APS in 2035, this share increases to 30%. Stationary storage will also increase battery demand, accounting for about 400 GWh in STEPS and 500 GWh in APS in 2030, which is about 12% of EV battery demand in the same year in both the STEPS and the APS.

Global battery manufacturing capacity by 2030, if announcements are completed in full and on time, could exceed 9 TWh by 2030, of which about 70% is already operational or otherwise committed. When assuming a maximum utilisation rate of 85%, this translates to the potential for almost 8 TWh of batteries to be produced in 2030, of which over 5.5 TWh is from plants already operational today and those with committed announcements. This level of production would be sufficient to meet global deployment needs in the APS and over 90% of the deployment needs in the NZE Scenario by 2030. Most of the announced manufacturing capacity remains concentrated geographically in today’s major EV markets. Of course, as EVs and stationary storage reach global markets and battery demand diversifies, new opportunities will be created around the world to produce batteries near demand centres. 1 3 5 7 9 STEPS APS NZE STEPS APS NZE 2030 TWh / year LDV Two/three-wheeler Bus Truck By mode 1 3 5 7 9 STEPS APS NZE STEPS APS NZE 2030 China Europe United States RoW Global By region Global EV Outlook 2024 Outlook for battery and energy demand PAGE | 144 IEA. CC BY 4.0. However, today’s front-runners, which have thus far dominated the supply of batteries to EV makers in China, the European Union and the United States, are still expected to play a critical role in the coming decade. In China, the total committed battery manufacturing capacity is over two times greater than domestic demand in the APS by 2030, opening opportunities for export of both batteries and EVs with batteries made in China, but also increasing financial risks and reducing margins of battery producers. Notably, in both the United States and European Union, battery manufacturing capacity that is already operational or otherwise committed is almost or already sufficient to meet projected battery demand in the APS by 2030. Companies operating in these regions will, however, need to scale up production rapidly and demonstrate that they are cost-competitive in order to satisfy all or a large share of their domestic demand. About 70% of the 2030 projected battery manufacturing capacity worldwide is already operational or committed, that is, projects have reached a final investment decision and are starting or begun construction, though announcements vary across regions. This encouraging signal from the battery industry indicates that it is ready to produce the batteries needed to achieve road transport electrification and stationary storage targets in full. Over 40% of announced manufacturing capacity in China relies on the expansion of current plants, indicating the strengthening of industrial actors that are already part of the Chinese market. Elsewhere, 80% of announced US and EU manufacturing capacity is expected to come from new plants, with a significant number of new actors entering those markets in the coming years. The announced manufacturing capacity outside of China, the European Union and the United States, of which 85% is already committed, together with today’s capacity, can meet almost half of APS needs in 2030 in these other regions. Almost all the committed manufacturing capacity is divided among other European countries and Canada (about 35% each), India (12%), other Southeast Asian countries (8%), particularly Viet Nam, Malaysia and Singapore, and Japan and Korea (5%). Korea and Japan, however, also account for over 80% of today’s capacity in these regions. There is significant space for growth in South American countries, which today have no significant announced battery manufacturing capacity by 2030, and in countries with manufacturing capacity that falls short of their pledges, such as India, whose announced capacity would cover only a quarter of its demand in the APS. These gaps have important implications for future battery trade and could increase the risk of these regions failing to meet long-term decarbonisation targets without relying significantly on imports.

Battery recycling technology and industry players are already getting ready for the 2030s As the EV stock ages, effective end-of-life strategies that encompass recycling and reuse must be put in place to make supply chains circular and to help mitigate critical mineral demand. The battery recycling sector, still nascent in 2023, will be core to the future of EV supply chains, and to maximising the environmental benefits of batteries. Global recycling capacity reached over 300 GWh/year in 2023, of which more than 80% was located in China, far ahead of Europe and the United States with under 2% each. Confident in the transition to electromobility, many technology developers and industry actors are seeking to position themselves in the future market for EV end-of-life management and have announced considerable capacity expansions.

The main sources of supply for battery recycling plants in 2030 will be EV battery production scrap, accounting for half of supply, and retired EV batteries, accounting for about 20%. Of course, scrap materials remain in an almost pristine state, and therefore are much easier and cheaper to recycle and feed back into the manufacturing plant. While the supply of both battery scrap and retired EVs will increase, current expansion plans and outlooks suggest that battery recycling capacity could be in significant overcapacity in 2030: total supply in 2030 could account for only one-third of the announced recycling capacity in the STEPS and APS. In the short term, overcapacity could also have important financial implications for the business models of recycling companies unable to secure stable sources of end-of-life batteries, resulting in significant consolidation of the market. However, the outlook could still change depending on whether announcements translate into final investment decisions (FIDs), and it is important to note that a rapid growth in retired EV batteries is expected starting from the second half of the 2030s.

Supply of retired batteries for stationary storage, portable electronics, and micromobility refers to data provided by Circular Energy Storage. Battery production and EV retirements are based on the Announced Policy Scenario (APS). Sources: IEA analysis based on data from Circular Energy Storage. Policy also has an important role to play, such as for traceability, quality, safety, and sustainability of recycling practices. In China, for example, a new regulation announced in December 2023 will assign responsibility for EV battery traceability and recycling to EV manufacturers and to battery manufacturers for battery-as-aservice applications, with the view to bring the suppliers and consumers of endof-life EV batteries closer together. This policy move comes as supply for recyclers in China grows rapidly, and as the number of small, unofficial and unregulated recycling companies increases accordingly. This has raised concerns that they are operating without extensive battery technology expertise, environmental and safety standards, nor reliable traceability systems. Strong regulation for battery recycling already exists in some regions outside of China, especially in Europe. However, these regulations could still be made more comprehensive to solve existing challenges, notably the transport of end-of-life batteries and black mass, 36 and to improve tracking systems and safety and environmental standards. This is even more important given that the future 36 Lithium-ion battery recycling is typically composed of two main steps: pre-processing and material recovery. Preprocessing refers to batteries being discharged, dismantled, and mechanically or thermally treated to condition them to ease material and metal recovery, typically in the form of black mass. Material recovery refers to the recovery of battery materials and metals after the pre-treatment step. 400 1 200 1 600 2030 GWh Stationary storage Portable electronics Micromobility EV retirements EV production scrap Max recycling capacity Global EV Outlook 2024 Outlook for battery and energy demand PAGE | 148 IEA.

The evolution of battery chemistries and technology innovation will also have an impact on the recycling landscape of 2030. Of the two principal battery chemistries of today, nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) and lithium iron phosphate (LFP), the former is particularly well suited for recycling because it contains greater quantities of valuable metals. In contrast, LFP batteries have a lower residual value after recycling, which could put pressure on recycling business models. Nonetheless, regulations can fill this gap by either incentivising or mandating the recycling of end-of-life batteries regardless of their residual value. This is already the case for lead-acid batteries used in ICEVs, which have significantly lower residual values compared to any type of lithium-ion battery but whose recycling rate can be up to almost 100% thanks to regulation. The lower residual value of LFP makes recycling uneconomical in Europe and the United States today, but LFP recycling is already economical in China, even though this is strongly affected by the market price for lithium. In this regard, the Chinese recycling industry is preparing to build sufficient LFP recycling capacity to meet future demand. If all announced plants are built in full and on time, capacity suited to recycle LFP is expected to be two times greater than potential supply by 2030.

In the APS, demand could be higher, standing at about 2 700 TWh in 2035, or over 20% more than in the STEPS, although the stock of EVs would be only around 15% higher. Several factors contribute to the disproportionate increase in EV electricity demand between the STEPS and APS. In the APS, rates of electrification are higher in markets where the average vehicle mileage is high, such as the United States. The APS also sees greater electrification for trucks and buses, which contribute incrementally to vehicle stock while pushing up electricity consumption and mileage, resulting in greater electricity demand per vehicle. In countries with net zero pledges, the APS assumes that a greater share of the distance covered by PHEVs will be driven in full electric mode, thereby requiring more electricity and less gasoline or diesel. This is particularly relevant for cars and vans, which account for more than two-thirds of demand in both the STEPS and the APS. By 2035, EV electricity demand accounts for less than 10% of global final electricity consumption in both the STEPS and APS. As shown in the World Energy Outlook 2023, the share of electricity for EVs in 2035 remains small in comparison to demand for industrial applications, appliances, or heating and cooling. Further, the electrification of road transport results in overall reductions in energy consumption, given that electric powertrains are more efficient than internal combustion engines. Total road energy demand in the APS decreases by 10% in 2035 compared to 2023, despite road activity (vehicle kilometres travelled) increasing 20%. 2023 2030 2035 2030 2035 2030 2035 STEPS APS NZE China Europe United States India Japan Rest of the world 500 1 000 1 500 2 000 2 500 3 000 3 500 4 000 2023 2030 2035 2030 2035 2030 2035 STEPS APS NZE TWh LDV Two/three-wheeler Bus Truck By mode By region Global EV Outlook 2024 Outlook for battery and energy demand PAGE | 150 IEA.

The size of the EV fleet becomes an important factor for power systems in both the STEPS and APS, with implications for peak power demand, transmission, and distribution capacity. As the fleet grows, careful planning of electricity infrastructure, peak load management and smart charging should be priorities for near-term decision-making. Effective management of fast charging, in particular, will be needed to allow for optimal planning and resilience of power systems and to mitigate peak power demand. In both the STEPS and APS, over 80% of the electricity demand for electric LDVs in 2035 is met with slow chargers. To support policy-making and help countries prioritise charging strategies according to the size of their EV fleet and power system configuration, the IEA has developed a guiding framework and online tool for EV grid integration. Oil displacement Electric vehicle uptake means oil demand for road transport is set to peak around 2025 and displace 12 mb/d by 2035 Growing EV stocks reduce the need for oil. Globally, the projected EV fleet displaces 6 million barrels per day (mb/d) of diesel and gasoline in 2030, a sixfold increase on displacement in 2023. By 2035, even less oil is needed for road Global EV Outlook 2024 Outlook for battery and energy demand PAGE | 151 IEA. CC BY 4.0. transport, with displacement reaching 11 mb/d in the STEPS and 12 mb/d in the APS. In fact, we expect global demand for oil-based road transport fuels to peak around 2025. Displacement is largely attributed to electric LDVs, followed by trucks, buses and 2/3Ws.37 In particular, it will be important to closely track the uptake of electric 2/3Ws and their role in oil displacement: electric 2/3Ws may displace active modes of travel such as walking or cycling, rather than just fossil-powered transport, which is the assumption underpinning the STEPS and APS. This highlights that while EVs are an important component of transport decarbonisation, they are far from being the only one.

Notes: STEPS = Stated Policy Scenario; APS = Announced Pledges Scenario; NZE = Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario; RoW = Rest of the world; LDV = light-duty vehicle. Oil displacement is based on internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle fuel consumption to cover the same mileage as the EV fleet. Oil displacement is calculated by assuming that the distance (total kilometres) travelled by EVs by segment each year would have been otherwise travelled by ICE vehicles or hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). In the case of PHEVs – where the powertrain uses both oil-based fuel and electricity, only the distance covered by electricity is included. This method of estimation assumes that EVs replace ICE or hybrid vehicles of the same segment, and that these vehicles follow the same driving behaviour. The accuracy of this assumption is uncertain. There is some evidence to suggest that EVs are driven further than their ICE counterparts, for example. Tax reforms will be needed to ensure government revenues can be sustained as EV adoption grows Fossil fuel excise taxes can represent a major source of income for governments, and they are often used to fund road infrastructure. The shift to EVs may 37 As reported in the Global EV Outlook 2023, assumptions about which mode(s) of transport are displaced by electric 2/3W trips can greatly impact the resulting oil displacement.

Notes: STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; APS = Announced Pledges Scenario. Fuel tax rates are assumed to remain constant. Only federal tax rates are included. Source: Analysis based on tax rates from IEA Energy Prices. Although China leads global EV stock uptake, 60% of current revenue losses are in Europe, because the taxes for gasoline and diesel are far greater. For example, the gasoline tax rate in France, Germany, and Italy is more than six times that in China. In Europe, fuel tax revenue drops by nearly USD 70 billion by 2035 in the STEPS. In China, tax revenue losses reach USD 17 billion, and they remain under USD 300 million in the United States due to low federal taxation of gasoline and diesel (though greater impacts could be seen at the state level). However, for oil-importing countries, lost tax revenues could be balanced by reduced fuel import costs.

Longer-term measures to stabilise tax revenues will be needed in the transition to electromobility. Policy strategies could involve more wide-ranging tax reforms, such as coupling high taxes on carbon-intensive fuels with distance-based charges. For example, Israel recently approved a new usage tax on kilometres travelled, which will apply to EVs as a way to compensate for lost revenues from excise duty on gasoline and diesel. Road tolls could charge users of road infrastructure. When used in city areas, tolls could also reduce traffic congestion, noise pollution and road infrastructure damage, while encouraging the uptake of alternative modes such as public transport, walking and cycling. Further, the EV transition can also bring monetary benefits due to health improvements associated with reductions in air pollution, for example by reducing health expenditures, preventing premature deaths and avoiding workdays lost due to illness. A study of the benefits of electric cars in Shanghai estimated that benefits exceed USD 6 000 per EV when replacing an average Chinese ICEV. About 40% of this monetary benefit is attributed to health benefits, and the remainder to climate benefits. Global EV Outlook 2024 Outlook for emissions reductions PAGE | 154 IEA. CC BY 4.0. 10.

However, there remains a substantial ambition gap between announced pledges and what would be required to put the world on a path consistent with the NZE Scenario. This is especially true in the near term: in 2030, 40% more emissions are avoided in the NZE Scenario compared to the APS, in which only around 5% more emissions are avoided than in the STEPS. By 2035, the gap between the NZE Scenario and APS emissions savings narrows to less than a 35% difference. At the same time, the APS net emissions reductions increase to over 10% relative to the STEPS. Current policies are not aligned with a net zero by 2050 pathway, and nor are announced pledges, calling for greater ambition in policy and corporate decision-making. Chinese passenger LDVs alone accounted for about 35% of global road transport avoided emissions in 2023, an important reminder of the benefits of switching to electric sooner rather than later to unlock greater cumulative CO2 benefits. As other segments and regions catch up, this share falls to 25% in 2035 in the STEPS. By 2035, trucks account for almost 15% of avoided emissions globally, and buses nearly 5%. Early adoption of electric 2/3Ws meant that they accounted for almost 10% of avoided emissions in 2023. While this share falls to 5% by 2035, electric 2/3Ws are providing substantial cumulative emissions savings in the interim. Global EV Outlook 2024 Outlook for emissions reductions PAGE | 155 IEA. CC BY 4.0. The prospect of retail price parity between electric and ICE cars in some regions and segments by 2030 (see section on Electric car availability and affordability), combined with stronger policy support for electrification of cars than for other vehicle segments, means that the LDV segment is more closely aligned with the NZE Scenario than other segments. In the STEPS and APS, the LDV segment achieves more than 80% of the net avoided emissions by 2035 seen in the NZE Scenario. In contrast, buses are the least aligned with the NZE Scenario, with the STEPS accounting for 20% and the APS only 30% of the emission reductions in the NZE Scenario. For trucks, the STEPS achieves almost half of the net avoided emissions seen in the NZE Scenario in 2035, while the APS delivers almost 70% – a reflection of strong policies in the United States and European Union and pledges across a wider variety of countries.

In both the STEPS and APS these benefits increase over time as the electricity mix is decarbonised further. Globally, in the STEPS, the lifecycle emissions of a medium-size battery electric car are about half of those of an equivalent ICEV that is running on oil-based fuels, more than 40% lower than for an equivalent HEV, and about 30% lower than for a PHEV over 15 years of operation, or around 200 000 km. These emissions savings increase by around 5 percentage points in the APS, as the grid decarbonises more quickly than in the STEPS. When comparing vehicles purchased in 2035, an ICE car produces almost two-and-a-half times the emissions of a battery electric car in the STEPS, and over three times as many in the APS, over the vehicle lifetime. For a medium-sized car, this equates to 38 t CO2-eq over the ICE car lifetime compared to 15 t CO2-eq for a BEV.38 Power grid decarbonisation around the world is crucial for maximising the environmental benefit of BEVs. In terms of global averages for medium-size vehicles sold in 2023, well-to-tank emissions decrease by 25% to 35% thanks to electricity emissions intensity improvements foreseen in the STEPS and APS. For vehicles purchased in 2035, well-to-tank emissions decrease by 55% (in the STEPS) and 75% (APS) thanks to grid decarbonisation, as the emissions intensity of electricity generation drops 50-65% between 2023 and 2035. However, even without these improvements, BEV emissions would still be about 30% lower than those from ICEVs. Grid decarbonisation in the APS also causes emissions from battery production to fall by about 10% by 2035. Vehicle size also plays an important role in determining lifecycle emissions. Many consumers are choosing larger vehicles than previously, prompted in part by model availability. Though smaller vehicles are clearly preferable in terms of both production and operation emissions across powertrains, the greater efficiency of an electric powertrain means electrification mitigates much of the negative impact of larger vehicles. While some large ICE SUVs can emit up to 50% more emissions than a medium-sized ICE car, a large battery electric SUV emits only around 20% more than a medium-sized battery electric car over its lifetime. Choosing a battery electric SUV over an ICE vehicle represents a lifecycle emission saving of about 38 See Annex B for further details on the assumptions behind this lifecycle analysis. Global EV Outlook 2024 Outlook for emissions reductions PAGE | 157 IEA. CC BY 4.0. 60%. Even compared to a medium-size ICEV, a battery electric SUV results in 40% lower lifecycle emissions. See the earlier section on model availability for more information. PHEVs purchased in 2023 produce around 30% less emissions than ICEVs over the course of their lifetime in the STEPS, while this gap reaches 35% for vehicles purchased in 2035 in the APS, thanks to further decarbonisation of electricity generation. This analysis assumes that the utility factor (share of kilometres travelled on electricity) of PHEVs is 40%.39 Greater lifecycle emissions savings can be achieved if the utility factor is higher. In fact, the rated utility factor for PHEVs with range of 60 km is around 65%. However, analysis from the past few years has shown that the real-world utility factor is significantly lower than the official values from vehicle type approvals (such as the World Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure). The European Commission published a report finding that the real-world CO2 emissions from PHEVs were on average 3.5 times higher than the laboratory values. A main factor behind this discrepancy is that PHEVs are not charged and driven in full electric mode as frequently as assumed. A separate study has suggested that the realworld utility factor is lower for company cars compared to privately owned cars, because those vehicles tend to be charged less frequently. Increasing PHEV charging and the use of the battery mode would result in greater reductions in emissions, but such measures are difficult to enforce.

CC BY 4.0. Regionally, the lifecycle emissions benefits of BEVs vary, depending in particular on the local grid emissions intensity, average annual driving distance, and fuel economy of ICEVs. The potential for emissions savings from BEVs is relatively high in the United States, thanks to the high annual mileage of cars and projected rapid power grid decarbonisation. The emissions intensity of the US average grid mix falls by 70% by 2035 in the STEPS. As a result, the lifecycle emissions of a BEV purchased in the United States today are around 45%, 60%, and 65% lower than those of a PHEV, HEV and ICEV. Compared to the ICEV, this amounts to a net lifetime savings almost 50 t CO2-eq for a medium-sized BEV. In the United Kingdom, annual mileage is lower than in the United States – and closer to the global average – and, as a result, the lifetime emissions savings for a battery electric car compared to an ICE car amount to less than 20 t CO2-eq per vehicle. The average annual mileage in India is broadly similar to the United Kingdom, but the emissions intensity of power generation is higher, given a high use of coal. As result, BEV lifecycle emissions are similar to PHEV and HEV (<10% difference), and just 20% lower than ICEV. Thus, a battery electric car in India saves less than 10 tonnes of CO2-eq over its lifetime compared to an ICE medium-sized car. However, it is worth noting that there are significant efforts to decarbonise electricity generation in the country: the emissions intensity of the grid falls to 60% of today’s level by 2035 in the STEPS. The environmental benefit of road electrification in India will therefore increase rapidly in the next years. Even today, electrification can already offer important public health advantages by decreasing air pollution in India’s mega cities, like Mumbai. In China, BEV emissions are about 20%, 30%, and 40% lower compared to PHEV, HEV and ICEV, respectively, equivalent to almost 5 tonnes of CO2-eq (compared to a PHEV) and up to 10 (compared to an ICEV) for a medium-sized vehicle. Despite the emissions benefits of BEVs being lower in China than in Europe and the United States, its larger battery electric car fleet – over 16 million vehicles compared to over 6.5 million in Europe and around 3.5 million in the United States – makes China the leading country for GHG emissions saved through road electrification.

In the context of carbon tariffs, or eligibility rules for EV subsidies based on lifecycle emissions, EV and battery producers might therefore be incentivised to rely more on LFP batteries, which today are almost exclusively produced in China, rather than the more emissions-intensive NMC batteries. The main source of emissions across the battery lifecycle depends on the chemistry. Critical minerals processing accounts for 55% of total emissions for NMC, compared to 35% for LFP. Battery manufacturing accounts for almost 50% of LFP total emissions, against 15% for NMC. The production of active material for both cathode (NMC or LFP) and anode (graphite) materials is also important, and currently accounts for about 25% of NMC and 15% of LFP emissions. Strategies to reduce emissions from high-nickel chemistries should focus on critical minerals processing, such as for nickel ores. Improving energy and process efficiency for critical minerals processing, active material production and battery manufacturing can also help, as can electrification along different steps in the supply chain, whenever possible. At the same time, as more retired EV batteries become available, replacing increasing shares of material inputs with recycled content will not only reduce emissions but also improve overall battery supply chain sustainability. In the case of LFP batteries, in particular, decarbonisation strategies should focus on reducing battery manufacturing emissions through higher efficiency and electrification, while reducing emissions associated with lithium ore processing. Using low-carbon electricity can also support the decarbonisation of battery production. Electricity-related emissions today account for about 20% and 25% of NMC and LFP total lifecycle emissions, respectively. Sourcing this electricity from lower-carbon sources 40 is therefore important, but it is not sufficient for deep battery decarbonisation, which would require higher levels of electrification compared to today’s 20-25% electrification rates over the entire battery cell supply chain. Other important strategies to reduce battery-related emissions are increasing the energy density, which decreases the battery material intensity, and recycling. In the APS, battery lifecycle emissions decrease by about 35% for both NMC and LFP through 2035, thanks to 30% higher energy density at the battery pack level, decarbonisation of power grids, and 20% of the cathode active material sourced through recycling. 40 Electricity carbon emission in this analysis ranges between 400 and 420 g/kWh for the different battery supply chain steps.

Global EV Outlook 2024 Annexes PAGE | 165 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Annex B: Lifecycle analysis assessment “Tank-to-wheel” emissions are emissions from fuel combustion. “Well-to-tank” emissions are associated with fuel production over the vehicle lifetime. In the case of EVs, well-to-tank emissions are those associated with electricity generation, distribution and charging losses; for ICEVs they are the upstream emissions associated with the production, refining and transport of the gasoline. “Grid decarbonisation impact” refers to the effect of electricity emissions intensity improvements over the lifetime of the vehicle. Assumptions behind emission values used in this report Emission values for car production are for a medium-sized passenger light-duty vehicle and based on weighted global averages by production of the materials. The battery electric vehicle (BEV) is considered to have a real-world range of 350 km with a battery capacity of 60 kWh. The plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) is considered to have a gasoline engine, a battery capacity of 15 kWh to enable a 60 km electric range, and a utility factor of 40%, meaning 40% of the kilometres are electrically driven. Fuel economy improvements over time vary by scenario and by region. For the world average, a lifetime activity of about 200 000 km over 15 years is assumed. For the regional analysis, lifetime activity of about 330 000 km, 170 000 km, 120 000 km, and 260 000 km is assumed for the United States, United Kingdom, China, and India, respectively. Calculations of lifecycle emissions account for mileage decay, assuming that highest annual mileage occurs in the first year of operation, with mileage in each subsequent year being equal to around 95% of the previous year. This means that by year 15, the car is driven for around half of the annual mileage of year 1. By taking into account mileage decay, our LCA results place more emphasis on the near term, as opposed to assuming constant mileage over the car’s lifetime. Biofuel blending is not considered. Improvements in the emissions intensity of gasoline production are included, in line with those of IEA modelling in the respective scenario. For car production, world averages related to energy inputs and emissions intensity of mining and material production are assumed. Actual vehicle production emissions would vary based on regional energy mixes associated with each supply chain step. Global EV Outlook 2024 Annexes PAGE | 166 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Battery emissions are calculated using the 2023 chemistry sales-weighted average. NMC811 (lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2)) is used as a representative chemistry of the high-nickel class, given its larger market share today and considering that lifecycle emissions for individual battery designs within that class are similar. The battery pack energy densities used refer to the 2023 sales-weighted average and are around 135 Wh/kg for LFP and 165 Wh/kg for NMC811. 2035 emissions assume 30% increased energy density at the battery pack level, and 20% of the cathode active material sourced through recycling.

CC BY 4.0. Abstract The Global EV Outlook is an annual publication that reports on recent developments in electric mobility around the world. It is developed with the support of members of the Electric Vehicles Initiative (EVI). The report draws on the latest data to assess trends in electric vehicle deployment, demand for their batteries and charging infrastructure. It considers recent policy developments and industry strategies shaping the outlook for electric vehicles in different markets. This edition features analysis of electric vehicle affordability, manufacturing and trade of electric cars and their batteries, and the total cost of ownership of electric heavy-duty trucks across various markets, and makes projections to 2030. The report is complemented by updated versions of two online tools: the Global EV Data Explorer and the Global EV Policy Explorer, which allow users to further explore EV statistics and projections, and policy measures worldwide.

CC BY 4.0. Electric Vehicles Initiative The Electric Vehicles Initiative (EVI) is a multi-governmental policy forum established in 2010 under the Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM). Recognising the opportunities offered by EVs, the EVI is dedicated to accelerating the adoption of EVs worldwide. To do so, it strives to better understand the policy challenges related to electric mobility, to help governments address them and to serve as a platform for knowledge-sharing among government policy makers. The EVI also facilitates exchanges between government policy makers and a variety of other partners on topics important for the transition to electric mobility, such as charging infrastructure and grid integration as well as EV battery supply chains. The International Energy Agency serves as the co-ordinator of the initiative. Governments that have been active in the EVI in the 2024-25 period include Canada, Chile, People’s Republic of China (hereafter “China”), Finland, France, Germany, India, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, United Kingdom and United States. The Global EV Outlook annual series is the flagship publication of the EVI. It is dedicated to tracking and monitoring the progress of electric mobility worldwide and to informing policy makers on how to best accelerate electrification of the road transport sector. Global EV Outlook 2025 Executive summary PAGE | 10 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Executive summary Electric car sales continue to break records globally, particularly in China and other emerging economies Electric car sales exceeded 17 million globally in 2024, reaching a sales share of more than 20%. Just the additional 3.5 million electric cars sold in 2024 compared with the previous year is more than the total number of electric cars sold worldwide in 2020. China maintained its lead, with electric cars accounting for almost half of all car sales in 2024; the over 11 million electric cars sold in China last year were more than global sales just 2 years earlier. As a result of continued strong growth, 1 in 10 cars on Chinese roads is now electric. Europe saw sales stagnate in 2024 as subsidy schemes and other supportive policies waned, but the sales share of electric cars remained around 20% as stronger sales in some countries compensated for lower sales in others. In the United States, electric car sales grew by about 10% year-on-year, reaching more than 1 in 10 cars sold. Emerging markets in Asia and Latin America are becoming new centres of growth, with electric car sales jumping by over 60% in 2024 to almost 600 000 – about the size of the European market 5 years earlier. In Southeast Asia, electric car sales grew by nearly 50% to represent 9% of all car sales in the region, with notably higher sales shares in Thailand and Viet Nam. In Brazil, the largest car market in Latin America, electric car sales more than doubled to 125 000 in 2024, reaching a sales share of over 6%. Sales in Africa also more than doubled, too, mostly thanks to growing sales in Egypt and Morocco, though electric cars still represent less than 1% of total car sales across the continent. Policy support and relatively affordable electric car imports from China played a central role in increasing sales in some emerging electric vehicle (EV) markets, accounting for 85% of electric car sales in both Brazil and Thailand, for example. Across all emerging economies outside of China, Chinese imports made up 75% of the increase in electric car sales in 2024. Expected growth in electric car sales is led by China and Europe, alongside a surge in emerging economies Electric car sales in 2025 are expected to exceed 20 million worldwide to represent more than one-quarter of cars sold worldwide. Sales were up 35%"}

Sales were up 35% year-on-year in the first three months of 2025, with record first-quarter sales in all major markets. In China, the continuation of incentives for replacing older vehicles and falling electric car prices mean electric cars are projected to reach around Global EV Outlook 2025 Executive summary PAGE | 11 IEA. CC BY 4.0. 60% of total car sales in the country in 2025. Emissions standards in the European Union and the United Kingdom will require higher shares of zeroemission car sales in 2025. Building on more than 20% year-on-year sales growth observed in the first quarter, these policy pushes are expected to drive up electric car sales in Europe in 2025 to reach a sales share of 25%, despite flexibility given to automakers for meeting the 2025 EU emissions reduction target. While the 2025 outlook for electric car sales in the United States is uncertain based on today’s policy direction, sales are currently expected to maintain the 10% growth observed in the first quarter; as consumers take advantage of existing tax credits in view of their potential repeal, electric car sales are projected to reach 11% of total car sales over the full year. In emerging economies other than China, sales are expected to continue growing strongly, increasing by 50% to reach 1 million in 2025. Despite uncertainties in the outlook, the share of electric cars in overall car sales is set to exceed 40% in 2030 under today’s policy settings. China is poised to continue leading in electric car sales to 2030, achieving a sales share of around 80% on the back of significant market momentum and competitively-priced EVs. In Europe, carbon dioxide (CO2) targets support the achievement of a sales share of close to 60% by 2030, slightly below last year’s projection. The sales share in the United States grows much more modestly than in our Outlook last year, reaching around 20% by 2030 based on today’s policy direction – less than half the share projected for 2030 last year. In Southeast Asia, meanwhile, electric car sales are boosted by strong policy support and available domestic manufacturing capacity: by 2030, one in four cars sold in the region is poised to be electric. Two/three-wheelers – an important mode of road transport in the region – electrify faster: by 2030, almost 1 in 3 such vehicles sold are electric. Across all vehicle modes, the deployment of EVs replaces the use of more than 5 million barrels of oil per day globally in 2030, an important energy security consideration. Half of these savings are the result of EV adoption in China. Uncertainty about the evolution of trade and industrial policy, downside risks to the economic outlook, and lower oil prices could affect EV uptake – but also car markets overall. Higher tariffs might increase the price of cars, including electric cars, and their components; lower GDP growth could dampen car sales; and lower oil prices affect the fuel cost savings from the use of electric cars. The way these factors will play out in practice is uncertain, but on aggregate they look to pose risks for overall car sales volumes more than for the share of EVs. In China, continued political support and competitive EV prices suggest that EV sales can withstand such headwinds. In Europe, where price differentials with conventional cars are larger, the combination of longer-term policy ambition and examples of policy responses from the pandemic suggest that sustaining EV sales is possible. Low oil prices can reduce fuel savings offered by battery electric cars, but even at global benchmark oil prices of USD 40 per barrel, there would be Global EV Outlook 2025 Executive summary PAGE | 12 IEA.

Global trade of electric cars is growing as manufacturers eye new markets China continues to be the world’s EV manufacturing hub and is responsible for more than 70% of global production. Car manufacturers headquarted in China predominantly cater to the domestic market, accounting for around 80% of domestic sales in 2024 and almost all of the 25% growth in global EV production. In the European Union, production stalled at 2.4 million electric cars in 2024. North America saw contrasting trends: US production declined whereas Mexico’s output doubled, supported by comparatively low manufacturing costs. Roughly 70% of Mexico’s output was from US-headquartered manufacturers. Production also increased by 15% in Asia Pacific countries other than China, reaching about 1 million electric cars, mostly from incumbent carmakers from Japan and Korea. Global trade of electric cars increased 20% in 2024; imports now represent almost one-fifth of global electric car sales. At 40% (nearly 1.25 million electric cars), China accounted for the largest share of global exports in 2024. The European Union also remained a net exporter of electric cars: exports reached over 800 000, mostly destined for other European countries (such as the United Kingdom) and North America. EU imports were below 700 000, of which 60% came from China. The United States remained a net importer of electric cars; imports increased by nearly 40% in 2024, while exports fell by nearly 15%. Chinese EV export markets are diversifying as Chinese automakers make headway in Brazil, Mexico and Southeast Asia. Several potential markets for Chinese EV exports have recently adopted or are considering the use of tariffs. This has prompted Chinese manufacturers to either frontload their exports before such tariffs come into force (as in Brazil) or to seek new markets for their available output. Today, overseas manufacturing capacity from Chinese manufacturers supplies about 5% of electric car sales in emerging markets and is set to grow further. Competition and declining battery prices are improving affordability, though progress is uneven As a global average, the price of battery electric cars fell in 2024, but the purchase price gap with conventional cars persisted in many markets. The average battery electric car price in Germany, for example, remained 20% higher than that of its conventional counterpart. In the United States, battery electric cars remained 30% more expensive, dampening future sales growth expectations. In Global EV Outlook 2025 Executive summary PAGE | 13 IEA. CC BY 4.0. contrast, two-thirds of all electric cars sold in China in 2024 were priced lower than their conventional equivalents, without considering purchase incentives for EVs. This helped boost sales even as government incentives decreased. Chinese electric car models are typically cheaper than the average EV in emerging markets, bolstering the competitive position of the Chinese industry. In Thailand, the average price of a battery electric car has now reached parity with an average conventional car, and the Chinese electric cars available are, on average, even cheaper. In Brazil, the price gap between battery electric cars and conventional cars shrank to 25% in 2024 from over 100% in 2023 as Chinese electric car imports grew to 85% of the country’s EV sales. Similarly, the average price premium of battery electric cars in Mexico fell to 50% in 2024 from more than 100% in 2023 as Chinese imports reached two-thirds of sales. Low critical mineral prices and increasing competition between battery manufacturers drove down battery pack prices in all markets in 2024, albeit with significant variations. In China, prices fell by about 30%, compared with 10-15% in Europe and the United States. The faster pace of cost reductions in China – enabled by strong competition, increasing manufacturing efficiency and supply chain integration, and access to a skilled workforce – is increasing the competitive advantage of Chinese battery manufacturers. Improving charging coverage, capacity and integration is key to growing adoption of electric vehicles Public charging stations have doubled in the past 2 years to keep up with growing EV sales. China and the European Union have maintained a steady pace of charger deployment compared with the number of EVs on the road. However, in both the United States and United Kingdom, which have higher rates of access to home chargers than China, public charger build-out has not kept pace with EV deployment, and the number of electric light-duty vehicles per public charging point increased in 2024.

Charging capacity is an important measure of the adequacy of public charging networks. The number of ultra-fast chargers, with power ratings of 150 kilowatts (kW) and above, grew by about 50% in 2024 and now account for nearly 10% of all public fast chargers. Public slow chargers in urban areas are a solution for EV owners without access to home charging, but fast chargers along highways help enable long-distance trips. In Europe, over three-quarters of all highways have a fast-charging station at least every 50 kilometres, compared with less than half of US highways. Globally, public charging capacity for light-duty EVs would need to grow by almost ninefold to 2030 to support EV sales implied by stated policies. Even so, EVs are set to account for only 2.5% of total global electricity demand in 2030. Global EV Outlook 2025 Executive summary PAGE | 14 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Government efforts to promote interoperability, standardisation, smart charging and vehicle-to-grid integration can ease the transition to EVs for drivers and grid operators. Technologies such as smart chargers and vehicleto-grid-capable EV models are becoming more available, but new market structures and legal frameworks will be needed for vehicles to maximise the potential benefits for the grid. China and the United Kingdom stand out for policy implementation and demonstration projects in this area. Battery technology innovations in recent years are also enabling safe high-power charging that could be as quick as refuelling a conventional car, but fully realising these advances hinges on deploying adequate infrastructure. The value proposition for electric trucks is improving, even for long-haul operations Electric truck sales grew by nearly 80% globally in 2024 to reach close to 2% of total truck sales. Spurred by a new scrappage scheme for conventional trucks, China’s electric truck sales doubled to 75 000 vehicles, representing over 80% of global sales in 2024. In Europe and the United States, electric truck sales in 2024 remained similar to 2023 levels. The number of battery electric truck models available has grown from less than 70 in 2020 to more than 400, increasing the number of applications that can be met by electric trucks. The total cost of ownership of a battery electric heavy-duty truck is already lower than for a diesel equivalent in China in certain cases. The purchase price of battery electric heavy-duty trucks remains two to three times higher than equivalent diesel trucks in major markets, which can discourage fleet operators, who often operate under tight margins. However, greater efficiency and lower energy costs – even including the cost of a high-power charger – make battery electric trucks more attractive the more they are used. By 2030, battery electric trucks in Europe and the United States are expected to reach parity on the total cost of ownership with diesel trucks for long-haul operations, as they already have in China, and are set to remain more cost-effective than hydrogen fuel cell trucks. However, the specific application and use profile of trucks are key factors for determining which powertrain technology is most suitable, meaning case-by-case analysis may be needed to evaluate the costs of various alternatives. Mandated rest periods for truck drivers can play an important role in reducing the opportunity cost of charging en route. For long-haul trucking, the wait time for recharging an electric truck can pose difficulties for logistics operators. However, the 45-minute rest period mandated in the European Union can accommodate the addition of around 150 km of driving range for a heavy-duty truck using a 350 kW charger, and up to about 400 km if a megawatt charger is used. While the United States and China also have mandated rest periods, the design of the EU policy is currently most conducive to supporting EV adoption.

China maintained its lead among major markets, with electric car sales exceeding 11 million – more than were sold worldwide just 2 years earlier. Global sales were slightly tempered by stagnating growth in Europe, as subsidies were phased out or reduced in several major markets, and as the EU CO2 targets for cars remained the same between 2023 and 2024. Electric car sales continued to increase in the United States although growth was about one-quarter that of the previous year. Significantly, outside of these three major markets, there was a record increase in sales of nearly 40% to reach 1.3 million, closing in on the United States’ sales of 1.6 million electric cars.

The rapid growth in electric car sales over the past 5 years has had a significant impact on the global car fleet: At the end of 2024, the electric car fleet had reached almost 58 million, about 4% of the total passenger car fleet and more than triple the total electric car fleet in 2021. Notably, the global stock of electric cars displaced over 1 million barrels per day of oil consumption in 2024. Of course, the stock of electric cars is not spread evenly across the world – in China, for example, around one in ten cars on the road is now electric, whereas in Europe the ratio is closer to one in twenty. Almost half of China’s car sales were electric in 2024, representing almost two-thirds of electric cars sold globally Electric car sales in China increased by almost 40% year-on-year in 2024, further driving up China’s share of global electric car sales. In 2021, China accounted for half of global electric car sales; this share grew to almost two-thirds in 2024. On a monthly basis, sales of electric cars have overtaken conventional car sales in the country since July 2024, bringing the share of electric car sales close to 50% for the full year. In China, 2024 marks the fourth consecutive year in which the electric car sales share grew by approximately 10 percentage points year-on-year. The growth in China reflects in no small part the growing price competitiveness of battery electric cars with conventional cars in the country. In addition, China’s electric car market benefitted from the introduction of a trade-in scheme in April 2024. The scheme, which is part of a wider economic stimulus package, applies to the purchase of conventional and electric cars alike, but with different levels of financial support. Following a retroactive increase, the scheme offers CNY 20 000 (Yuan renminbi) (USD 2 750) for consumers that replace an older vehicle (conventional or electric) with a new electric car, and CNY 15 000 (USD 2 050) for replacement with a new conventional vehicle. In 2024, about 6.6 million consumers applied for the incentive, 60% of whom bought an electric car. As such, more than one-third of the over 11 million new electric car sales in the country benefitted from this incentive. In recent years, sales of plug-in hybrid electric cars have been growing faster than sales of battery electric cars in China. The share of plug-in hybrid electric"}

As such, more than one-third of the over 11 million new electric car sales in the country benefitted from this incentive. In recent years, sales of plug-in hybrid electric cars have been growing faster than sales of battery electric cars in China. The share of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) sales, excluding extended-range EVs (EREVs)2, in China’s total electric car sales has risen from about 15% in 2020 to nearly 30% in 2024. Meanwhile, the share of EREVs has more than quadrupled since 2020, surpassing 10% in 2 If not otherwise specified, PHEVs includes EREVs. Extended-range EVs are a subset of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles that have both an internal combustion engine (ICE) and a plug-in rechargeable battery. Throughout this report, EREVs refer to plug-in series hybrid powertrain configurations where the ICE only operates without direct mechanical connection to the wheels to recharge the battery through an electric generator. Other plug-in hybrid configurations (such as parallel and seriesparallel configurations) fall under the “standard” PHEV category. EREVs generally feature larger battery and longer electric range than standard PHEVs. Global EV Outlook 2025 Trends in electric car markets PAGE | 17 IEA. CC BY 4.0. 2024. The acceleration of PHEV sales in China led the share of electric car sales that are battery electric to fall from 80% in 2020 to below 60% in 2024, though in absolute terms battery electric car sales increased sevenfold over the same period, demonstrating their continued appeal to new customers. In Europe, electric car sales stagnated in 2024 as policy support waned in major car markets About one in five new cars sold on the European market was electric in 2024, maintaining the sales share of the previous year. The electric sales share increased in 2024 in 14 out of 27 EU member states, while it either stalled or decreased in the rest, including in several larger markets, such as Germany and France, largely as a result of subsidies being phased out or reduced. In Germany, subsidies ceased at the end of 2023, while France has progressively reduced its subsidy over the years. At the start of 2024, France limited the amount of environmental bonus available to higher-income car buyers and reduced the number of vehicles eligible for the subsidy. Besides subsidies, the policy design of the European Union CO2 standards may also have held back further growth of the electric car market in 2024. As new targets come into effect every 5 years, car makers had no incentive to push sales of electric cars further in 2024 (in anticipation of strengthened targets in 2025). This is in contrast to markets such as the United Kingdom, where annually increasing targets move original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) towards electrification each year. In March 2025, the European Commission published its Industrial Action Plan for the European automotive sector, in which it proposed to amend the CO2 emission performance standards for cars and vans, granting them additional flexibilities by averaging their performance over a 3-year period. In the United Kingdom – the second-largest car market in Europe – electric car sales reached a share of nearly 30%, up from 24% in 2023. The year 2024 was the first under the Vehicle Emissions Trading Scheme, which required 22% of all new registrations to be BEV or fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV). When accounting for the scheme’s flexibilities, which allows OEMs to borrow credits from future years, they were able to comply with a battery electric car sales share of close to 20%. Norway reached near-total electrification of sales, with 88% of car sales being battery electric and just under 3% plug-in hybrid. As a result of the growing stock of electric cars, Norway’s oil consumption for road in 2024 decreased by 12% compared to 2021. From April 2025, a tax increase on conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) cars and PHEVs is expected to further increase the battery electric share towards meeting the Norwegian government’s 2025 goal of 100% zero-emissions car sales. In Denmark, the electric sales share increased by 10 percentage points to reach 56%, with nearly 100 000 electric cars sold. Global EV Outlook 2025 Trends in electric car markets PAGE | 18 IEA.

The market share of electric cars continued to expand in the United States In the United States, electric car sales increased to 1.6 million in 2024, with the sales share growing to more than 10%. However, growth in electric car sales slowed down significantly in 2024, increasing by just 10% compared to 40% in 2023. In spite of this, electric car sales did boost the overall car market, as sales of conventional cars stagnated. A total of 24 new electric car models were launched in 2024, increasing model availability by 15% compared to 2023, providing consumers with more choices and further increasing competition. While the Tesla Model Y and Model 3 have been the two best-selling models in the United States since 2020, the 110 new models that have entered the market since then have driven the market share of Tesla down from 60% in 2020 to 38% in 2024. Furthermore, 2024 was the first year in which Tesla saw a drop in sales in the United States, while other OEMs saw sales increase by 20% on aggregate. A modification to the US Clean Vehicle Tax Credit at the start of 2024 enabled buyers to receive an instant discount (up to USD 7 500 for a new electric car and USD 4 000 for a used electric car) at the point of sale, which may have served to entice interested buyers. However, not all electric cars were eligible for the credit: in 2024 about 20 electric models (not accounting for different trim levels) out of a total 110 were eligible, which translated to over half of US electric car sales. The real share that benefitted from the tax credit may be even higher. In 2023, provisions were introduced on leased electric cars to reclassify them as commercial vehicles, thereby making them eligible for the tax credit without having to meet requirements on local manufacturing. As a result, by 2024, nearly half of all EVs sold were leased, more than double the share seen 3 years earlier. In addition to the federal tax credit, in 2024, 27 states offered additional incentives, rebates and exemptions promoting electric car adoption.

Emerging markets saw a strong uptick in electric car sales Electric car sales shares doubled in a number of emerging markets In emerging and developing economies in Asia, Latin America and Africa, electric car sales increased by over 60% year-on-year in 2024, and the sales share almost doubled from 2.5% to 4%. This rapid growth has been strengthened by policy incentives and the growing presence of relatively affordable electric cars from Chinese OEMs. Emerging and developing economies in Asia (excluding China) saw a large increase in electric car sales, reaching almost 400 000 in 2024, up over 40% from 2023. However, in India, total electric car sales and their share of sales increased only slightly, approaching 100 000 (or 2%) in 2024.

This decline was outweighed by an even steeper 26% drop in conventional car sales, largely due to stricter lending criteria, meaning the electric sales share rose to 13% in 2024, up from 11% the previous year.

In many Southeast Asian countries, BEVs are the most popular electric car type, with over 90% of all electric car sales being fully electric. In Latin America, sales volumes and penetration rates doubled in many countries, with electric cars reaching a market share of 4% in 2024. Brazil towered over other countries in the region with nearly 125 000 electric car sales, more than twice the number of 2023 sales, and the electric sales share doubled to 6.5%. Costa Rica, Uruguay and Colombia also achieved impressive sales shares of around 15%, 13% and 7.5%, respectively. These increases are in large part the result of government incentives such as tax exemptions, reduced registration fees, a relaxation of traffic restrictions for EVs, and relatively high fossil fuel prices. In Africa, electric car sales more than doubled to reach nearly 11 000 in 2024. Sales shares remained low, at under 1%, though there was growth in several countries, such as Morocco and Egypt, where new electric car sales increased to more than 2 000.

VinFast has also started to export to 11 different countries, with the largest share of exports going to Southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia (44%) and Malaysia (22%), but also to the United States (22%). The company has announced plans to double domestic production in Viet Nam, as well as expanding manufacturing into India and Indonesia. Türkiye continues to deploy the domestically produced Togg electric cars, increasing its total production by 50% year-on-year. The increase in domestic production and in imports resulted in the country reaching an electric sales share of 10% in 2024. In July 2024, the Turkish government announced a USD 5 billion package to boost its annual production to 1 million electric cars per year.

CC BY 4.0. Overseas expansion plans of Chinese producers, prompted by changes to import tariffs, drove sales in emerging markets Another notable trend from 2024 was the numerous manufacturing announcements from Chinese OEMs in countries such as Brazil, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia, where temporary exemptions from import tariffs for electric cars are coming to an end. In 2024, electric car sales in Brazil more than doubled, with over 85% of new electric cars coming from China. A key factor behind this impressive growth was electric cars being exempt from import duties of 35%, though this exemption started to be gradually removed in 2024 and is set to end by the middle of 2026. By then, automakers BYD and GWM will have begun producing models in Brazil, with a range tailored to the Brazilian market, such as BYD’s Song Pro, which will be flex-fuel compatible. In Thailand, Chinese imports play a key role in electrification, accounting for 85% of electric car sales. However, as in Brazil, this share is expected to decline due to changes introduced in the EV 3.5 program, under which import taxes on electric cars will be reintroduced at the end of 2025 and existing subsidies of up to THB 100 000 (Thai baht) (USD 2 800) per imported car will be gradually phased out. To continue to qualify for the exemption and subsidy, OEMs must commit to producing at least two battery electric vehicles (BEVs) domestically by the end of 2026 for every imported BEV sold in 2024 and 2025. In Indonesia, electric car sales tripled in 2024 while the conventional market contracted by 20%, leading to an electric sales share of over 7%. The government has supported adoption by reducing the VAT rate on electric cars from 11% to 1% since 2023. However, what has potentially had an even greater impact on reducing the cost of electric cars for Indonesian buyers – and thus stimulating EV sales – has been the government waiving import taxes for EVs from car makers that invest in local electric car manufacturing from the start of 2024. Chinese car manufactures such as BYD and GAC Aion profited from this reduction, as did European OEM Stellantis. As a result, Chinese electric car imports increased 18fold to 34 000 by the end of 2024. In Malaysia, electric car sales more than doubled in 2024 and the sales share increased from less than 2% in 2023 to nearly 4% in 2024. Much of this success is due to imported electric cars being exempt from import taxes and excise duties until the end of 2025. Ahead of the tax exemption ending, Chinese car producer Geely, together with Proton (a Malaysian automotive company), will start domestically producing the e.MAS 7 by the end of 2025, backed by an investment from Geely. Malaysian OEM Perodua will also start producing its first electric car at the end of 2025, with a price of RM 80 000 (Malaysia ringgit) (USD 18 000).

In Uzbekistan, electric car sales shares doubled and the average price of an imported electric car fell almost threefold between 2023 and 2024. In Africa, local policies and changing trade regimes are reshaping the electric car market. Developments such as the ban on imports of petrol and diesel cars introduced in Ethiopia at the start of 2024 have resulted in a reported deployment of 100 000 electric vehicles.3 While model availability appears to be reasonable in the country, there are reports that garages struggle to source components for repairs, and that deployment of chargers outside of the capital has not kept pace with electric car sales. In Morocco and Egypt, efforts by car manufacturers to expand their production lines for batteries and/or electric cars in order to facilitate exports to the European Union have also pushed up domestic deployment, with the sales share reaching just under 2%. Nigeria is now looking into strengthening its EV manufacturing capacity with support from Morocco, and in 2024, signed the Zero Emission Vehicles Declaration to work towards all new sales of cars and vans being zero emission by 2040. First quarter sales hint at strong sales for 2025, despite many uncertainties Electric car sales increased 35% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 More than 4 million electric cars were sold in the first quarter of 2025 as sales grew by 35% compared to the first quarter of 2024, which was higher than the growth rate observed in the first quarters of the previous 2 years. Over 1 million more electric cars were sold in the first three months of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 and about 60% of these were sold in China. 3 Data on electric car deployment in Ethiopia is difficult to obtain, and sources are not well aligned. The Ministry of Transport of Ethiopia reports a stock of 100 000 electric vehicles but does not define how many of these are cars. In contrast, EV Volumes reports about 1 300 electric car sales in the past 5 years. Global EV Outlook 2025 Trends in electric car markets PAGE | 25 IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Between January and March 2025, China averaged monthly sales of around 875 000 electric cars, with total sales of more than 2.5 million. While the electric sales share was less than 45% in January, it reached more than 50% in both February and March. Across the full first quarter, the share of electric car sales was similar to that of 2024. In Europe, electric car sales reached more than 900 000 in the first quarter of 2025, 625 000 of which were sold in the European Union. The electric sales share has also been increasing, averaging one in four cars sold in Europe in the first three months of 2025. In the United Kingdom, electric cars represented 30% of cars sold in the first quarter, while in the European Union the share was less than 25%. More than 360 000 electric cars were sold in the United States in the first three months of 2025, around 10% more than during the same period the previous year. Total car sales grew at a similar rate, meaning the electric car sales share in the United States remained around 10%, the average across 2024. Several emerging electric car markets continued to see strong growth in the first quarter of 2025.

As a result, electric car sales top 20 million worldwide. While sales volumes may be impacted by economic and policy uncertainties, more than one in four cars sold in 2025 is expected to be electric.

Sales of both electric and conventional cars are supported by the extension of the trade-in scheme for older vehicles. The sales share of electric cars in China is expected to reach around 60% in 2025. The European Commission announced in March 2025 that OEMs would be given flexibilities in meeting the 2025 CO2 targets for cars and vans. On this basis, OEMs now only need to achieve the 15% emissions reduction target (compared to the 2021 baseline) on average over 2025-2027. This announcement was made in response to auto industry claims that the 2025 target would be unachievable, and would thus incur significant financial penalties that would damage the already struggling European auto industry. As yet, it is unclear how different OEMs will approach meeting the 3-year average target, in terms of the degree of underperformance that could be accepted in 2025 but would then need to be compensated for in the following 2 years. The new phase of the CO2 targets in the European Union is expected to drive up electric car sales, although the new flexibilities mean OEMs have less of an incentive to bring lower-priced electric cars to market this year. Given that a purchase premium for electric cars persists in Europe, the phase-out of EV purchase subsidies in some European countries could place downward pressure on sales, but there are signs to the contrary. At the end of 2024, the electric car purchase subsidy in the Netherlands came to an end, but electric car sales in the country in the first quarter of 2025 were about 10% higher than during the same period of 2024. In Italy, direct purchase subsidies for electric cars are no longer being renewed after 2024, though the government does aim to support the domestic production of EVs. In the first three months of 2025, electric car sales in Italy were up almost 50%. Over the course of the year, electric car sales are expected to reach around 4 million across Europe. In line with this, the share of electric cars sales would increase several percentage points compared to 2024, to around 25%. The increase in electric car sales across Europe is boosted by the UK Vehicle Emissions Trading Scheme, which sets the target of 28% battery electric car sales in 2025.

In 2025, this proposal may result in consumers that have been considering buying an electric car rushing to do so before the tax credit is removed. A dampening effect on EV sales in the United States is expected only once the tax credit is repealed, and the timeline for that is uncertain. In addition, tariffs for conventional and electric cars have also been announced, which may result in lower car sales.

The strong growth seen in Southeast Asia and Brazil is expected to continue, reaching sales of more than 0.5 million combined in 2025. Government spending on electric cars Subsidy phase-outs are leading to ever lower shares of government spending in the EV market As electric car sales have grown over the past decade, government spending per vehicle, in the form of purchase subsidies and tax incentives, has steadily declined – a trend that accelerated in 2022 as subsidies were phased out. In 2024, government spending accounted for less than 7% of total spending on electric cars globally, compared to 20% in 2017. In absolute terms, annual government spending on electric cars has hovered around the USD 38 billion mark since 2022. At the same time, total consumer spending on electric cars globally has grown continuously to reach USD 560 billion in 2024. Global EV Outlook 2025 Trends in electric car markets PAGE | 28 IEA.

China has had the largest absolute public spending since 2020, despite its subsidy scheme coming to an end in December 2022 after 12 years. Other incentives have remained in place – notably, electric cars being exempt from the 10% purchase tax that applies to other vehicles. In 2024, China introduced a trade-in subsidy with a higher premium for the purchase of EVs. The additional expenditure to support EV purchases is estimated to be around USD 2.7 billion for 2024.4 Nevertheless, Chinese government expenditure per vehicle dropped 25% between 2022 and 2024. China has the highest share of subsidies going to PHEVs, at nearly 45%, as a result of the 10% purchase tax exemption being applied to PHEVs, which are on average more expensive than BEVs. In contrast, government incentives for PHEVs have almost disappeared from other key markets. In Europe, subsidy schemes were significantly reshaped in 2023 and 2024. The most abrupt change was in Germany, where the EUR 4 500 per-vehicle subsidy was reduced to zero as of December 2023 – which was followed by a drop in EV market share of 4 percentage points in 2024. As a result, the German government 4 The original funding allocation for the car trade-in subsidies in 2024 was close to CNY 11.2 billion (USD 1.5 billion), however, for the full year, 6.6 million cars were traded in.

Similarly, Sweden ended its subsidy programme offering up to SEK 60 000 (Swedish kronor) (USD 5 800) per electric car in November 2022. Absolute volumes of electric car sales in the country decreased 10% in 2024, though the country’s EV sales share fell only very slightly due to a drop in overall car sales. In several other European countries, subsidies were either reduced in absolute terms, or their conditions have become more stringent, with a faster roll-back of subsidies for PHEVs. As a result, the average subsidy per vehicle in Europe has fallen rapidly, from more than USD 4 500 per vehicle in 2022 to around USD 1 000 in 2024. The phase-down or interruption of subsidy schemes in Europe has had differing consequences on EV market shares at the national level, but the rapid decrease in subsidies has not been followed by an equivalent decrease in EV market share, providing an encouraging sign of market resilience. In the United States, the introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act expanded the number of vehicles eligible for tax credits in 2023. However, the list of vehicles eligible for the USD 7 500 tax credit has since changed repeatedly as Internal Revenue Service guidelines have been implemented. The average tax credit in 2024 was approximately USD 4 000 per vehicle, since not all electric cars were eligible and some were eligible for only USD 3 750. In both 2023 and 2024, the United States had the highest per-vehicle subsidy of the three major EV markets. Global EV Outlook 2025 Trends in electric car markets PAGE | 30 IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Trends in the electric car industry Manufacturing and trade Steady growth in global electric car production masks differences at the regional level A total 17.3 million electric cars were produced worldwide in 2024, about onequarter more than in 2023, largely as a result of increased production in China, which reached 12.4 million electric cars. China remains the world’s electric car manufacturing hub, accounting for more than 70% of global production in 2024. Production in China has been increasingly shaped by the expansion of domestic manufacturers. In 2024, Chinese OEMs accounted for more than 80% of domestic production, up from roughly two-thirds in 2021. Despite the numerous recently announced foreign direct investment plans from Chinese OEMs, their overseas production has yet to ramp up. Electric car production by Chinese OEMs operating outside China accounted for less than 2% of their global output in 2024. In the world’s second-largest electric car manufacturing region, the European Union, production stagnated at 2.4 million cars in 2024, but surpassed domestic sales by more than 5%. Domestic carmakers were behind nearly 80% of the region’s total output, but there were contrasting trends among EU OEMs. While German OEMs marked a 5% year-on-year increase in their EU output, other EU OEMs (Stellantis and Renault) saw their regional production drop by over 15%, producing about 420 000 electric cars, or less than 20% of the region’s output.

Meanwhile, there was a sixfold increase in EU production by US OEMs between 2021 and 2024, predominantly led by Tesla and Ford. This contributed to the share of foreign OEMs in EU production reaching about 20% in 2024. Elsewhere in Europe, the United Kingdom saw its electric car output drop 30% year-on-year in 2024 to around 80 000 electric cars, while Türkiye’s production grew to 45 000, with two-thirds produced by domestic manufacturer Togg.

The gap between domestic production and sales in North America has increased steadily over the past 3 years. In 2024, despite electric car production falling 7% in the United States, overall output across the region remained unchanged year-onyear, as the decline in US output was offset by Mexico doubling its production to 220 000 electric cars. US-headquartered carmakers ramping up their manufacturing operations in Mexico were responsible for 70% of the country’s total output, followed by Japanese and EU OEMs contributing equally to the remaining 30%. Meanwhile, Canada’s output paled in comparison to its neighbours, remaining constant from 2023 at 25 000 vehicles. Electric car production also increased in Asia Pacific countries other than China to reach about 1 million. While incumbent carmakers such as Japan’s Toyota and Korea’s Hyundai were behind most of the region’s output, emerging EV players like VinFast in Viet Nam or Tata in India were responsible for an increasing share of production, growing from 10% in 2023 to 15% in 2024.

The European Union remained a net exporter of electric cars in 2024, despite importing about 680 000 electric cars. While imports from China remained steady in 2024 at more than 400 000 electric cars (60% of EU imports), the share of Chinese OEMs in imports from China grew to two-thirds in 2024, up from 50% in the previous year. The Chinese OEM Geely accounted for almost 40% of these imports, mainly through its brand Volvo Cars, while Tesla’s share decreased from 30% to 20% as more than half of its EU sales in 2024 were produced at its German assembly plant. Other European countries rely significantly on imports, primarily from the European Union. The majority of production elsewhere in Europe is based in the United Kingdom and Türkiye, but these countries were responsible for less than 15% of regional sales in 2024. China was the second-largest trade partner for electric cars, accounting for more than one-quarter of the 840 000 electric cars imported by non-EU European countries in 2024. The United States remained a net importer of electric cars in 2024. Exports fell nearly 15% year-on-year to less than 200 000 electric cars, while imports grew 40% to 630 000. In 2024, Mexico became the United States' largest electric car trade partner, with net exports to the United States reaching 145 000 vehicles. Imports from Mexico grew threefold compared to 2023, representing more than two-thirds of Mexico’s output. This surge was primarily driven by US OEMs (accounting for 70% of Mexico’s exports to the United States) and Japanese OEMs (20%). Japan and Korea, previously the largest next exporters to the United States, each accounted for net exports of roughly 135 000 vehicles in 2024. Despite being the top source of imports in gross terms, the European Union ranked fourth in net electric car exports to the United States in 2024, totalling about 110 000 vehicles. Meanwhile, 40% of US-made electric car exports went to Canada in 2024, making it the largest US export market. Japan and Korea accounted for the majority of the nearly 640 000 electric cars exported from the Asia Pacific region excluding China in 2024, primarily through their domestic manufacturers, with an increase of 15% from 2023. The United States was the main destination market for these exports, accounting for more than a quarter of the 1 million electric cars produced in the region. Europe followed, importing another quarter of the region’s production. Chinese exports are increasingly driven by domestic OEMs as their destinations diversify While it remains the world’s largest exporter of electric cars, China experienced a noticeable slowdown in export growth in 2024.

Several factors contributed to this slowdown. Firstly, the increase in trade restrictions resulting from tariff hikes in major export markets prompted Chinese OEMs to frontload their exports before such tariffs came into force. In Brazil for example, although Chinese imports saw strong year-on-year growth, with an increase of 120% in 2024, they dropped sharply by a factor of eight in the second half of the year following the reinstatement of tariffs. Europe remained the most important export market for Chinese-made electric cars, but weakening demand, reluctance of European consumers to buy Chinese EV brands and new countervailing duties in the European Union led the share of value attributed to Europe in total Chinese EV exports to fall from over 70% in 2021 to roughly 40%"}

CC BY 4.0. Inventory build-up by Chinese OEMs also contributed to the slowdown in Chinese export growth. In 2023, sales of Chinese-made electric cars outside China fell short by 275 000 cars compared to CAAM’s reported exports. This led to clogged destination seaports, particularly in Europe and Brazil, and limited the capacity for additional imports in 2024 until excess inventory was cleared. However, this stockpile helped sustain overseas sales growth of 35% for Chinese-made electric cars in 2024, while exports grew only 7%. Chinese OEMs accounted for 70% of 2024 total electric car exports from China, up from 55% in 2023. To sustain their export momentum, Chinese OEMs are investing in expanding shipping capacity through roll-on/roll-off (Ro-Ro) car carriers. In 2025, BYD commissioned the world’s largest Ro-Ro vessel, bringing its total shipping capacity to more than 30 000 electric cars. Meanwhile, a leading Chinese car shipping company, COSCO Shipping Car Carriers, announced plans to expand its fleet to handle up to 700 000 cars annually. Despite the 2024 export slowdown, this surge in shipping capacity positions Chinese OEMs for renewed growth, playing a crucial role in facilitating exports from China and emerging manufacturing hubs like Southeast Asia. Tightening trade restrictions are pushing Chinese OEMs to expand their overseas manufacturing footprint As Chinese electric car production continues to outpace domestic demand, Chinese OEMs are increasingly looking abroad to capture a larger share of the global electric car market. However, tariff changes across several regions are making it more difficult for Chinese-made electric cars to remain competitive in key destination markets. In 2024, multiple regions introduced new tariffs on Chinese electric car imports. This included the European Union, which imposed OEMspecific countervailing duties on Chinese battery electric car imports, aimed at offsetting alleged manufacturing subsidies received by OEMs in China. Meanwhile, the United States and Canada implemented new tariffs exceeding 100% in 2024, with further increases to tariffs on Chinese imports announced in 2025 in the United States, effectively deterring future Chinese electric car imports. Mexico and Brazil, both of which have recently experienced a surge in Chinese EV imports, have also approved tariff hikes. In 2024, Mexico ended its 15-20% tariff exemption on EV imports from countries without a free trade agreement, including China.

The free trade agreement between Thailand and China reduces the usually applied tariff rate from 80% to 0%. In June 2024, Türkiye imposed a 40% additional tariff on China-made cars and, one month later, exempted vehicles imported under investment incentive certificates. Brazil’s import duties on EVs are set to 18% (20% for plug-in hybrids) in the first half of 2025 and will gradually increase to 35% by 2026. The European Union’s import duties apply only to battery electric cars and vary across OEMs. Russia’s 15% tariff on EV imports does not include the recycling fee which amounts to USD 4 400 (RUB 360 000 Russian rubles) per imported EV. The Indian government announced a decrease in import duties to 15% for manufacturers committing to produce locally within 3 years with a minimum investment of about USD 500 million. 2024 value of Chinese EV exports is taken from General Administration of Customs of the People's Republic of China (GACC) interactive trade tables queried with HS codes 870360 and 870380.

The assembly plants being planned are intended to both directly supply local markets (like BYD’s plant in Brazil) and produce EVs for exports, thereby limiting exposure to tariff hikes targeting imports from China (such as from BYD’s plant in Türkiye for exports to the European Union). Most of the overseas production capacity owned by Chinese OEMs today is in the European Union, primarily through Volvo Cars’ assembly plants, which produced more than 160 000 electric cars last year. By 2026, when including both EV-only assembly plants and dual EV/ICE assembly plants, overseas manufacturing capacity belonging to Chinese OEMs is expected to almost double to reach over 4.3 million vehicles per year. Europe and Southeast Asia are likely to remain the primary locations of these new electric car assembly plants, with almost half of the total Chinese overseas manufacturing capacity being located in Europe by 2026.

While today there are 50% fewer electric models than ICE and hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) 2 models, this gap is narrowing and is expected to shrink to around 30% by 2027 based on announcements by OEMs. While its EV sales share remained largely unchanged, Europe saw the fastest increase in model availability over the past year, with a jump from 290 models to more than 360. The growth seen in 2024 is expected to almost double by 2026: As stricter emissions standards come into force in the European Union, more than 140 additional models are due to enter the market.

Mild hybrids use a battery and electric motor to help power the vehicle but cannot power the vehicle using electricity alone. A full hybrid can power a vehicle using electricity over short distances and at low speeds, thanks to its more powerful electric motor and larger battery.

The large car and SUV segments are the most profitable for OEMs, and many have therefore developed these models as a preference. As a result, the number of small and medium models available in China is only one-third of the number of large or SUV models. Yet despite model availability being more limited than for large cars, the small car segment is nearly fully electrified in China, with more than 90% of sales in the segment being electric. There were 45 small electric car models available in 2024, compared to fewer than 10 small conventional cars. The decline in number of conventional small models started in 2014 and by 2017 electric and conventional models were on par with around 30 models each. The small electric Seagull from BYD was one of the best-selling cars of 2024 across all segments and the bestselling small car, with about 440 000 sales. Sales came in just slightly behind the best-selling model overall, the Tesla Model Y (an SUV), which reached 485 000 sales. The fast pace of electrification of the small segment can be attributed to their affordability (see EV affordability in China), in combination with a push for local manufacturing and measures to improve air quality in China’s provincial ‘tier 3’ cities. In contrast, in Japan and Europe, the large car segment is the most electrified, and the small car segment the least. However, this does not necessarily reflect model availability: in Japan, the share of electric models on offer in the large car segment is about 50%, but only 6% of large car sales are electric. Similarly, in Europe, where more than 40% of all small and medium models available are electric, the electric sales share in these segments is just 20%. In the United States there are nearly 100 electric large or SUV models available, which is less than half of the number of ICE and HEV models available. Growing model availability supports EV adoption, but price appears to be the key determinant of EV penetration within small and medium size segments.

OEMs adopt different strategies for electric model announcements in different regions The number of electric models on the Chinese market today is already greater than the number of ICE and hybrid models. Based on announcements, and assuming the level of ICE and hybrid models remains constant, by 2030 there will be two electric models available for every conventional car model. Domestic OEMs such as BYD and Geely already offer twice as many electric models than conventional models. This is in contrast to the offering from OEMs headquartered elsewhere in the world, which have slightly fewer electric than ICE models available in China. However, this balance is likely to shift in favour of electric by 2030, with around 80 additional electric models announced. OEMs headquartered in Europe (such as Volkswagen, BMW and Mercedes) offer the most electric models after Chinese OEMs. Based on electric car model announcements, the gap between the number of conventional and electric models shrinks the most to 2030 in the European market. Chinese OEMs in this market already offer more electric models than conventional models, but European OEMs are now closing the gap by increasing their electric offerings by 50% by 2030, which is more than OEMs headquartered in other regions. About 40% of these new EV models are small or medium cars. Volkswagen and Stellantis, both of which have a greater focus on these vehicle segments than other European OEMs, are behind more than half of all announcements for small or medium models in the European market, as they are urged to release affordable models to meet their fleet-wide CO2 target in the short term. 300 900 1 200 1 500 World China United States Europe Japan Number of models BEV PHEV EREV Other cars 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 2016 2020 2024 World China United States Europe Japan Global EV Outlook 2025 Trends in the electric car industry PAGE | 43 IEA.

Electric vehicle range No change to average range of battery electric cars in The sales-weighted average range (hereafter, “average range”) of battery electric cars globally remained the same in 2024, at about 340 km under on-road conditions. The average range was significantly lower for small cars, at just above 150 km, while medium and large cars, as well as SUVs, all maintained ranges above 350 km. As market competition intensifies, the fact that average range has stabilised in the past year could indicate that carmakers have found an optimal balance between range performance and vehicle manufacturing costs. This levelling-off of driving range also offers energy and environmental benefits, as longer ranges also require larger batteries, which increase vehicle energy consumption and demand for critical minerals. In the United States and Europe, the average electric range increased by less than 5%, primarily driven by the growing interest in electric SUVs, which continued to dominate the EV market – exceeding 75% of sales in the United States and reaching around 60% in Europe. Across Europe, the average range of a battery SUV car reached almost 400 km under on-road conditions. Nevertheless, this falls short of the 500 km that respondents to a recent survey stated as their range preference. Meanwhile, in China, the average range remained stable as EV producers prioritised cost-cutting in the face of strong domestic competition.

Sources: IEA analysis based on EV Volumes and Marklines. Extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs) have gained ground in recent years, almost entirely as a result of growing adoption in China. Uptake has been primarily in larger and heavier high-end vehicle segments.

More than 70% of the 40 EREV models available today belong to the SUV category (including multi-purpose vehicles and pick-up trucks), while the rest is mostly part of the large car segment category. In total, 14 additional EREV models are expected to be released by the end of 2025. Similarly, the four announced EREV models due for launch outside of China by 2026 (by Scout and RAM in the United States and Changan in Europe), in addition to the two already available today (Mazda and Leapmotor in Europe), are all positioned within the large pick-up truck and SUV segments. Extended-range electric vehicles: advantages and limitations In 2024, the average EREV in China had an electric range of about 120 km, compared to around 85 km for a standard PHEV. While the range of a standard PHEV has increased significantly in recent years, the longer electric range of EREVs could reduce charging frequency, increase the share of electric-only driving and lower reliance on liquid fuels. As with standard PHEVs, the environmental benefits of EREVs are heavily influenced by charging behaviour and are generally overestimated in type-approval vehicle fuel economy ratings. In addition, when EREVs run on low battery, their fuel consumption compared to standard PHEVs varies depending on driving conditions. In some urban or low-power driving conditions, EREVs can be more fuel-efficient. However, in many other cases when the battery is low, the opposite is true: standard PHEVs tend to use less fuel because their engines can drive the wheels directly, unlike EREVs, which rely on a generator as an intermediate energy converter. The components of EREVs also differ from those of standard PHEVs. EREVs require a generator, advanced power electronics and a larger battery, which can increase manufacturing costs, although the lack of traditional transmission and simpler engine design can reduce costs. Their competitiveness compared to standard PHEVs largely depends on optimising the size of the generator and battery, which are responsible for the majority of additional costs. Moreover, their chassis design, which is closer to that of a BEV than a standard PHEV, could accelerate technology transfer from rapidly evolving BEV battery pack and chassis technologies. However, as battery electric cars continue to improve in range, charging speed and affordability, their simpler architecture and higher efficiency could outweigh the trend towards EREVs. Ultimately, wider adoption of EREVs will largely depend on the range and affordability of equivalent BEV models, as well as the availability of charging infrastructure.

For example, in China, the sales-weighted average (hereafter, “average”) price of a battery electric SUV fell almost 10% year-on-year in 2024, partly due to the 30% decline in the battery pack price. Similarly, in the United States, a 15% decline in battery prices contributed to a 3% drop in the average purchase price of electric SUVs in 2024. In contrast, in Germany, the price of electric SUVs slightly increased in 2024, despite their battery pack prices declining 20%. This suggests that the battery pack price is not the only factor influencing EV prices: other component manufacturing costs, trim levels and carmakers’ pricing strategies also play a significant role.

In 2024, there were fewer BEV models available than ICEV models in the United States and Europe, and the range was skewed towards higher-end models with higher prices. Conversely, in China, the price distribution of available BEV models closely resembles that of ICEVs, with about 40% of available electric models priced below USD 25 000 (against 45% for ICEV models), and more than half below USD 30 000. In 2024, this price distribution was reflected in sales, with the median price paid for a battery electric car standing at around USD 24 000, about USD 700 less than for an ICE car.

Contrasting trends were also seen in the affordability of plug-in hybrids. In China, prices for medium PHEVs dropped 15% from 2023 to 2024, and SUV-type PHEV prices fell 7% over the same period. However, in Germany, the average purchase price of medium and SUV-type PHEVs grew more than 5% year-on-year. This was partly driven by their average battery size growing, causing their battery pack prices to increase by about 15%. In 2024, in Europe, only 1 of the around 130 PHEV models was priced under USD 40 000, compared with more than 40 BEV and 155 ICEV models marketed below this price tag. Similarly, in the United States, the 4 cheapest PHEV models available were priced between USD 30 000 and USD 40 000, while about 60 ICEV models were marketed below this price range. The US and German markets contrasted markedly with that of China, where nearly 40 PHEV models were available with a price tag below USD 25 000, competing with more than 250 ICEV and 140 BEV models within the same price range. Price-competitive electric cars in China are driving rapid electrification across all segments In China, the rapid electrification of small cars has been underpinned by their unrivalled affordability. In 2024, nearly all small battery electric car models in China were priced lower than the average small ICE car, and the average purchase price was about half that of the average small ICE car. This led to the almost complete electrification – nearly 95% – of small car sales in China in 2024, up from a share of 75% 3 years earlier. Nevertheless, the small car segment makes up only a small share of the Chinese car market, accounting for less than 10% of sales in 2024.

In 2024, the average price premium of EREVs over ICEV models stood at 60%, marking slim progress from 70% three years ago. Despite their higher purchase price, the market share of EREVs within the SUV segment grew to reach 10% in 2024, suggesting that this hybrid powertrain technology is appealing to wealthier consumers who are less price sensitive and seek boosted range in high-end vehicle models. In the medium car segment, which represents about one-third of total car sales in China, BEVs were 20% more expensive than conventional equivalents in 2024, down from 40% in 2021. PHEV prices also dropped. For the first time, the salesweighted average price of medium PHEVs in 2024 was 10% lower than conventional models. As a result, PHEV sales in the segment more than doubled, and more than one-third of medium car sales in China in 2024 were electric. Electric car affordability improved in all car segments in China thanks to falling battery pack prices, a high level of supply chain vertical integration and fierce competition within the Chinese EV market. Overall, in 2024, close to two-thirds of the battery electric cars sold in China were cheaper than their ICE equivalents, up from half in 2021 and just 10% in 2018. Affordability stagnates in Europe, but carmakers expand lineups with low-cost EVs amid CO2 standards shift In Europe, carmakers’ pricing strategies and focus on high-profit-margin premium models have led to stagnating battery electric car prices. In Germany, for example, the average price premium for small battery electric cars remained almost unchanged between 2021 and 2023, plateauing at over 50% more than equivalent small ICE models. The price premium for small battery electric cars fell slightly in 2024 to around 45%. In contrast, the price premium for battery electric SUVs increased to reach 20% in 2024, effectively reversing the small decrease seen over the 2021-2023 period. The price premium of PHEVs compared to conventional equivalents has grown consistently since 2022, reaching more than 30% for medium-size cars and 50% for SUV-type cars in 2024. This trend hindered electric car adoption in Germany in 2024, especially when combined with the phase-out of purchase subsidies in late 2023. In 2021, almost one-third of battery electric SUVs sold in the country were cheaper than their average ICE equivalent, but by 2024, this share had fallen to one-fifth. Global EV Outlook 2025 Trends in the electric car industry PAGE | 52 IEA. CC BY 4.0. In other European countries, the affordability of electric cars saw little change. In the United Kingdom, for instance, the average price premium of battery electric SUVs made only slim progress, dropping to 30% in 2024 from 40% in 2021. The pricing trend of plug-in hybrid SUVs was similar, with their price premium having been stuck at around 45% for the last 3 years.

In 2024, while nearly one-quarter of available ICE car models were priced below EUR 30 000, only around 5% of battery electric models were. Models priced below EUR 25 000 are expected to be key enablers of wider market adoption, but they accounted for only a slim share (3%) of available battery electric models in Europe last year. However, the new phase of the EU CO2 standards entering into force in 2025 is expected to prompt carmakers to release more affordable electric models to boost their EV sales and comply with their respective fleet-wide CO2 targets. So far, both European and foreign carmakers have announced launches of battery electric models for the European market priced at under EUR 25 000, including Renault, Volkswagen, Hyundai, and BYD. Overall, nearly ten battery electric models priced at under EUR 25 000 are expected to be released by the end of 2026. Limited availability of affordable models hinders US electric car sales growth In 2024 in the United States, about one in five electric SUVs (including pick-up trucks) was sold at a lower price than the average conventional SUV. This is particularly significant given that SUVs account for three-quarters of total car sales in the United States. Progress on battery electric car affordability has fluctuated in recent years. In 2023, the average purchase price premium of battery electric SUVs noticeably decreased to 25% from 50% in 2022, largely as a result of Tesla repeatedly slashing prices in an attempt to maintain its market lead in the United States. However, despite further price reductions to the Tesla Model Y SUV in 2024, Tesla’s market share fell around 10% year-on-year. This decline outweighed the impact of the late price cuts, leaving the average price premium of battery electric SUVs in the United States unchanged from the previous year. The contrast with conventional models is stark: in 2024, only 2 battery electric models (3% of battery electric car models) were priced below USD 30 000, compared to more than 50 ICE models (20% of available ICE models). In the short term, Honda and Volkswagen have recently announced they will launch “affordable” compact electric SUVs, bringing to market a handful of models under the USD 30 000 mark. However, most of the BEV model releases expected by 2026 that have been announced with launch prices are in the premium car category, with over 70% anticipated to have a purchase price of more than USD 50 000.

The cheapest Chinese battery electric car was, in most cases, also the cheapest option on the market, so much that in Thailand in 2024, the average price of a Chinese EV was lower than the average price of a conventional car. In 2023 and 2024, more than four out of every five battery electric cars sold in Thailand were imported from China, bringing the average price of BEVs nearly in line with that of conventional cars.

In particular, plug-in hybrid SUVs – which accounted for nearly half of Brazil’s electric car sales in 2024 – saw their price premium over ICE equivalents drop below 70%, compared to a premium of more than 80% for battery electric SUVs. This decreasing price gap boosted the adoption of PHEVs within the SUV segment, whereas BEVs gained more traction in the small and medium car segments, where their average price premium halved year-on-year to reach less than 40% in 2024. In Indonesia, after import duties were waived under local investment requirements, Chinese EV imports surged to reach two-thirds of the country’s EV sales in 2024, up from about 10% in 2023. Like in other emerging markets, Chinese battery electric car models became the most affordable options available, with an average price over 60% lower than BEVs from non-Chinese OEMs. As a result, the average price premium of BEVs dropped to around 50% in 2024, down from being, on average, twice as expensive as conventional cars in 2023. In Mexico, the average price premium of BEVs fell to 50% in 2024 from more than 100% in 2023, as the share of Chinese imports in EV sales grew to nearly twothirds.

CC BY 4.0. 3. Trends in other light-duty electric vehicles Electric two- and three-wheelers Contrasting regional trends mean global sales of electric two- and three-wheelers remain at around 15% Two- and three-wheelers (2/3Ws)1 remained the most electrified road transport segment in 2024, with more than 9% of the global fleet now electric. The global sales share of electric models remained at around 15% in 2024 with total electric model sales reaching 10 million. The electric sales share stalled in 2024, mostly due to the shrinking Chinese electric 2/3W market, although growth in other regions was steady. China, India and Southeast Asia remain the world’s largest 2/3W markets, accounting for around 80% of 2024 global sales, with 2/3Ws serving as the primary mode of private passenger transport in India and Southeast Asia. Electric 2/3Ws stand out as the most affordable and accessible entry point into electric mobility. Unlike cars, many models do not rely on extensive charging infrastructure, as removable batteries allow users to charge at home, and those with private parking or garages can easily charge their electric 2/3Ws using standard sockets. The removable batteries have also led to the growing emergence of battery swapping stations for 2/3Ws, which can be particularly useful for 2/3Ws that are used as taxis or for delivery services, where quick recharging is highly valued. This – combined with lower operating costs when compared to cars – means that electric 2/3Ws offer a promising solution for reducing urban emissions and improving air quality in emerging markets and developing economies, where 2/3Ws are widely used for daily transportation. Another year of receding electric two-wheeler sales in China masks steady growth elsewhere in Asia In China, falling sales of electric 2Ws in 2024 were the product of an overall decline in the 2W market, yet the country remains the world’s largest market for electric 2Ws. Electric models have accounted for more than half of 2W sales since 1 In this report, “two-wheelers” refers to vehicles with a top speed of at least 25 km/hr that fit the L1 and L3 classes defined by UNECE. This excludes micromobility options such as electric-assisted bicycles and low-speed electric scooters. The definition of a three-wheeler is aligned with UNECE L2, L4 or L5 classes.

Sluggishness in China’s 2W market reflects an increasing preference for cars for personal transport, and may also be a sign that consumers are responding to tighter restrictions on 2W use in major cities. The 2W market is shifting toward higher-value motorcycle models, likely indicating a change in consumer profile.

India’s increasingly dynamic electric 2W market hosted a total of 220 OEMs in 2024, up from 180 in 2023, although the 4 market leaders accounted for a combined 80% of the 1.3 million electric 2Ws sold in the country in 2024 (6% of the overall 2W market). While the upfront purchase price of electric 2Ws remains higher on average than that of conventional 2Ws, increasing competition is prompting OEMs to offer more affordable electric models. For example, the Indian market leader, Ola, released its S1X entry model, equipped with a 2 kWh battery and 6 kW peak power, with a sticker price of INR 70 000 (about USD 850) – lower than the average price of the five best-selling ICE 2W models. Policy support is also helping to bridge the affordability gap between electric and ICE 2W models, with the new PM Electric Drive Revolution in Innovative Vehicle Enhancement (PM E-DRIVE) policy continuing financial support formerly provided under both Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME)-II and Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme measures. This provides purchase incentives for electric 2Ws (offering purchase subsidies of up to INR 5 000/kWh for 2Ws fitted with lithium-ion batteries), as well as for 3Ws and other emerging EV categories (specifically excluding private cars), with a total budget of USD 1.3 billion. The scheme is planned to operate until March 2026 to support the roll-out of about 2.5 million electric 2Ws, up from 1 million targeted under the previous FAME-II policy. On the manufacturing side, the 80 largest electric 2W makers in India accounted for a combined production capacity of 10 million electric 2Ws in 2024, almost 8 times the domestic sales that year. Capacity is expected to increase to 17 million electric 2Ws in the near term, if all OEM announcements come to fruition. Southeast Asia made notable progress on 2W electrification in 2024, particularly in Viet Nam, which recorded 250 000 sales (a sales share close to 10%); in Indonesia, where there were about 105 000 sales; and in the Philippines, with more than 25 000. Indonesia saw its electric 2W market almost double in size, but the share of electric sales remained below 2%. Nevertheless, the trend towards electrification in what is the world’s third-largest 2W market is likely to continue given the strong policy support in place (in 2023, nearly USD 0.5 billion was allocated to support the deployment of 800 000 electric 2Ws over the following years), as well as the new manufacturing capacity being rolled out by established Chinese OEMs. Viet Nam’s 2W electrification success story has been underpinned by the continued roll-out of increasingly affordable electric 2W models manufactured by domestic champions like VinFast and Pega, and now also by Chinese OEMs. To date, several electric models are sold at under VND 20 million (Vietnamese dong) (USD 780) (such as VinFast’s Evo200 and Yadea’s Orla), making them pricecompetitive with conventional alternatives. These affordable purchase prices are partly a result of existing battery leasing options, which reduce the vehicle purchase price and can cost consumers as little as VND 350 000 (under USD 14) per month.

CC BY 4.0. increasing affordability of electric models, ongoing development of charging infrastructure for models without removable batteries, and Viet Nam’s ambition to fully electrify its road transport sector by 2050 is likely to drive further growth in electric 2W sales in the coming years. Sales of electric 2Ws in Africa grew nearly 40% year-on-year to reach 9 000 vehicles, marking a slim 0.5% sales share in the continent’s total 2W sales. However, domestic OEMs have invested significantly in recent years to set up domestic manufacturing facilities. For example, Spiro is set to break ground on an assembly plant in Nigeria in 2025 with an expected annual output of 100 000 electric 2Ws, 100 times the capacity of its assembly plants in Togo and Benin. Other electric 2W manufacturers, such as Roam in Kenya and Ampersand in Rwanda, also recently announced investments to ramp up their capacity across African countries. Beyond increasing manufacturing investments, asset financiers like M-KOPA, Mogo, and Watu are helping consumers and small business owners access electric motorcycles through flexible payment plans and lease-to-own schemes. Elsewhere, in Europe, the average electrification rate of 2W sales has decreased to about 6%, despite the 2W market growing overall. With year-on-year sales growing to more than 50 000 electric 2Ws, Türkiye has secured its position as the leading market outside of Asia, followed by France and the Netherlands, despite those markets stagnating in 2024. India continues to drive most growth in the global electric three-wheeler market Despite the global three-wheeler (3W) market shrinking 5% from the previous year, electric 3W sales grew more than 10% to surpass 1 million vehicles in 2024. Electric 3W sales represented almost one-quarter of all 3W sales, up from onefifth in 2023. The market is highly concentrated, with China and India together accounting for more than 90% of both electric and conventional 3W sales.

Electrification of 3Ws in China has stagnated at less than 15% over the past 3 years. In 2023, India overtook China to become the world’s largest market for electric 3Ws, and it maintained this position in 2024, with sales growing close to 20% year-on-year to reach nearly 700 000 vehicles. This translated into a record 57% electric sales share in 2024, 3% up on the previous year. This growing trend looks set to continue thanks to policy support under the new PM E-DRIVE scheme, which allocated budget in 2024 to support the roll-out of more than 300 000 electric 3Ws for commercial use – for which the total fleet (electric and ICE) was estimated at more than 10 million vehicles in 2023. Elsewhere, in Europe, the electric 3W sales share has grown steeply in the past 2 years, pushed up by growth in the Turkish market. In 2024, Türkiye accounted for 60 000 electric 3Ws sold out of a total European 3W market of about 90 000. Electric light commercial vehicles China pushed up global electric light commercial vehicle sales in 2024, representing 70% of global sales Sales of electric light commercial vehicles (LCVs) increased by more than 40% in 2024 to exceed 600 000, with a share of 7%, up from 5% in 2023. China and Europe remained the two largest markets for electric LCVs in 2024, but while China saw growth of almost 90%, with sales reaching roughly 450 000, sales in Europe declined by about 10% to less than 120 000.

To better align with IEA classifications, diesel light-duty trucks are considered as mediumduty trucks (defined here as having a gross vehicle weight greater than 3.5 tonnes and less than 15 tonnes). Sources: IEA analysis based on data from EV Volumes, China Commercial Vehicle Dealers Association, DaaS, ACEA, Marklines and Korean Automobile Manufacturers Association. The continued sales growth in China has been supported by LCVs being eligible for the vehicle purchase tax exemption for new energy vehicles that was put in place in 2014. The full tax exemption has been extended through 2025, and a 50% tax exemption will be available until the end of 2027. Preferential road rights policies, charging discounts and charging subsidies are further supporting EV adoption among commercial users. In Europe, the electric sales shares declined in several important LCV markets, such as Germany, Norway and France, or stalled, as in the case of Sweden. However, in the United Kingdom – the largest market for electric LCVs in Europe – sales continued to grow, reaching nearly 7%. As with cars, 2024 was the first year of zero-emission van targets under the Vehicle Emissions Trading Scheme, which will progressively require higher sales shares of zero-emission LCVs over the coming decade. Some small markets such as Czechia, Greece, Hungary and especially Romania have seen notable increases, albeit starting from a very low base. Despite no new incentives being introduced between 2023 and 2024 in these markets, the growth suggests that there were some segments that could be easily electrified with existing technology. In fact, the total cost of ownership of electric LCVs is already equal to or below that of conventional alternatives for certain applications in Europe. Nevertheless, in Germany – a more developed market – the decline in sales may have been a result of the removal of incentives (which also affected LCV applications that are harder to electrify based on current pricing or model 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 100 300 500 700 '20 '22 '24 '20 '22 '24 '20 '22 '24 '20 '22 '24 '20 '22 '24 World China Europe United States Korea Sales (thousands) Electric LCV sales Electric car sales share (right) Electric LCV sales share (right) Global EV Outlook 2025 Trends in other light-duty electric vehicles PAGE | 63 IEA.

Some European cities have promoted electric LCV adoption by establishing Low Emissions Zones (LEZs), though there is no uniform European regulation, with regulations being decided at the city level. London has the largest LEZ in the world, which has favoured uptake. As of the beginning of 2025, LEZs can also be found in Amsterdam and 14 other cities in the Netherlands, as well as in Brussels, Ghent, and Stockholm. In the case of the Netherlands, the introduction of LEZs from 2025, together with the exemption of vehicle tax for LCVs being removed for ICE LCVs, led the sales share of electric LCVs to leap to more than 90% in the first quarter of 2025, compared to less than 10% on average in 2024. The number of LEZs in Europe grew significantly from 228 in 2019 to 320 in 2022, with more expected to come online in 2025, further encouraging uptake of EVs and improving air quality, while also potentially reducing traffic congestion. In 2023, the sales share of electric LCVs in Korea was double the level of electric passenger cars, continuing a trend that started in 2020. While the sales share of electric LCVs remained higher than cars in 2024, both the volume of sales and their sales share declined sharply.

Despite strong initial adoption of electric LCVs in Korea, partially due to the availability of free commercial licence plates for electric models, drivers have since reported that real-world range and model availability is insufficient for many commercial applications, which may be influencing the slowdown. In 2023, the only electric LCVs on the market were the Kia Bongo and the Hyundai Porter, both 1-tonne trucks with a battery capacity of about 60 kWh. While these vehicles had initially been able to meet the needs of some portions of the market, boosting sales, reaching new market segments has proved difficult. In 2024, Hyundai launched the ST1 Cargo electric, which has a larger battery (76 kWh) and an advertised range of around 300 km, but also has a higher purchase price. In 2024, Korea introduced stricter performance requirements for their subsidy scheme, which effectively restricted subsidies for models with lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, typically used in Chinesemanufactured models. Across Europe, Korea and the United States, 2024 saw the introduction of around ten new electric LCV models, the majority of which were launched in European countries. Ford expanded its e-Transit line, which remains one of the world’s bestsellers in the electric LCV category, offering a 30% increase in range and more possible applications, such as refrigerated delivery.

Electric LCV fleets are becoming increasingly popular, particularly in the parcel delivery sector, as companies strive to reduce their environmental impact and operating costs. As part of its goal to reach 100 000 electric delivery vehicles by 2030, Amazon now has 20 000 vehicles through a 2019 agreement with Rivian, which has tailored a vehicle to Amazon's needs, with the first vehicles delivered in 2021. In 2024, Rivian represented 40% of the US electric LCV market and its sales are steadily growing. Elsewhere, Ingka Group, the biggest IKEA franchisee, served 40% of home deliveries with zero-emission vehicles, advancing towards its goal of more than 90% by 2028. Shanghai was the first city to reach this goal, achieving 100% EVbased deliveries as early as 2019.

CC BY 4.0. In Europe, the world’s second-largest market for electric buses, sales increased by almost 15% in 2024, bringing the sales share to more than 13%. Several countries, including Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands and Norway, now have electric bus sales shares of more than 40%. The United Kingdom continues to have the largest number of sales in Europe, accounting for around 20% of the region’s sales in 2024, with a year-on-year growth of over 40% and almost 2 000 electric buses sold in 2024. Italy follows, with almost 1 200 sales, and then Germany with almost 900. Sales were predominantly for city buses, for which ten European countries had battery electric sales shares above 80%, meaning almost half of all new city buses were battery electric in 2024, up from just over 35% in 2023. Uptake of electric buses in the United States has not been linear. Despite averaging year-on-year growth of more than 70% between 2020 and 2024, electric bus sales declined in 2024 following a peak the previous year. Around 40% fewer electric buses were sold last year, in part due to supply chain issues. As a result, India and Korea overtook the United States to become the second- and thirdlargest national electric bus markets by sales volume in 2024, with more than 3 200 and 2 800 sales, respectively. In Latin America, electric bus sales have risen from around 600 in 2020 to over 2 000 in 2024, which accounts for almost 40% of sales outside of China, Europe, and the countries mentioned above. City buses are driving the transition, like in Europe. In Mexico, close to 8% of all bus sales were electric in 2024, up from just above 1% in 2023. There has also been impressive growth in Colombia, Chile, Brazil, and other countries over the past few years. Another notable trend is the decline in the share of PHEVs among electric buses. In China, the share of PHEVs in total electric bus sales peaked in 2014 at around 60%, but fell to less than 1% in 2017 and close to 0% in 2024. Similarly, in the rest of the world, there was a peak of around 60% of total electric bus sales in 2015, but this fell sharply to 5% in 2017, and around 1% of the share in 2024. Almost all electric bus sales are now battery electric, thanks in large part to declining battery prices, greater model availability and improved charging technology, all of which increase the share of use cases for which they are now practical. Even as electric bus economics continue to improve, innovative financing and incentives help drive deployment Innovative financing models, such as those available in the United Kingdom, Brazil (São Paulo), and Chile (Santiago), are also helping to drive up sales. In Santiago, for example, buses have been leased to the operator as opposed to traditional ownership, lowering the upfront cost, which can present a significant barrier to deployment. The scheme benefitted from investment by the International Finance Global EV Outlook 2025 Trends in heavy-duty electric vehicles PAGE | 67 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Corporation (IFC). A similar model is being explored for collaboration between the IFC and Transvolt in India to help deploy 8 000 battery electric buses. Italy, which now has the highest number of electric bus sales in the European Union, more than doubled its stock from 2023 to 2024, with growth fuelled by incentives totalling EUR 50 million made available in July 2022. As in other countries, the majority of electric bus registrations are intended for urban use. In Milan, for example, the municipal public transport operator, ATM, has committed to having a 100% electric fleet by 2030. In the United States, uptake has been greatest for school buses, which represented around half of the electric bus stock in 2024. As of mid-June, the Clean School Bus Program had funded approximately 8 100 electric school buses, using approximately USD 3 billion of the USD 5 billion allocated for fiscal years 2022-2026 under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

This contrasts starkly with the experience of New York City, which has a legally binding target to fully electrify its fleet of 10 000 buses by 2035, yet has deployed under 50 to date, partly due to difficulties in negotiating affordable purchases. India has seen rapid growth in electric bus deployment since 2020, with stock increasing from less than 3 000 to more than 11 500 at the end of 2024. A combination of increasingly favourable economics, available incentives and additional government support for charging infrastructure has enabled huge yearon-year growth. Demand has been boosted by schemes such as the National Electric Bus Programme, which targets deploying a further 40 000 electric buses by 2027, helping to generate large orderbooks and use aggregated procurement to drive down costs. This is further strengthened by new schemes such as PM EDRIVE, which could support sales of a further 14 028 electric buses, with preference given to replacements of old public buses. The forthcoming Bharat Urban Megabus Mission aims to introduce 100 000 electric buses to cities with a population of over 1 million. China’s electric bus sales strengthen, but Chinese OEMs are also focusing on exports China has the world’s highest stock share of electric buses, at 30%, compared to 2% across Europe (the second-largest electric bus fleet), and this share has been steadily growing over the past decade. The country took an early lead in deploying electric buses, with almost 70% of the more than 680 000 electric buses in the country today having been deployed before 2020. The year 2024 saw an increase in electric bus sales following several years of decline, potentially reflecting the replacement of older electric buses in cities such as Shenzhen, which fully electrified their bus fleets years ago. The introduction of a national-level city bus scrappage scheme announced in January 2025 looks likely to further support the uptick in sales seen in 2024. Global EV Outlook 2025 Trends in heavy-duty electric vehicles PAGE | 68 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chinese manufacturers have also been increasingly looking to exports to exploit their available manufacturing capacity. In 2024, more than 15 000 electric buses were exported from China, over 25% more than in 2023. BYD and Foton are some of China’s leading manufacturers of electric buses, and together with other Chinese manufacturers supplied more than 80% of electric buses in Latin America's stock. In early 2025, the city of Tashkent, Uzbekistan, signed a purchase agreement for 2 000 BYD buses, 1 000 of which are set to be delivered by the end of the year. Chinese OEM Yutong has also seen success internationally, fulfilling orders in Greece, Italy and the United Kingdom, and solidifying their position as Europe’s best-selling electric bus brand for the third year in a row. Yutong has already supplied fleets to places as diverse as Chile, Mexico, Norway and Uzbekistan since 2020. In Qatar, 70% of the public bus fleet was electrified between 2021 and 2023 through a partnership with Yutong, supporting the government’s aim for all of its public transport buses to be electric by 2030. The Qatari government has also made plans for domestic production of electric buses in partnership with Yutong, with the aim of establishing a production hub for electric buses to serve international markets including Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, as well as meeting growing local demand. Global electric truck sales grew by almost 80% in 2024 New incentives help China strengthen its lead as overall progress stalls in Europe and the United States Sales of electric medium- and heavy-duty trucks grew for the third consecutive year in 2024 to exceed 90 000 worldwide. Year-on-year growth was almost 80%, a stark contrast to the decline in sales seen between 2018 and 2021. This spurt was largely a result of Chinese sales more than doubling between 2023 and 2024 – more than 80% of all electric trucks sold globally in 2024 were sold in China. Strong growth in China was spurred in part by a vehicle scrappage scheme including purchase incentives, which is being renewed in 2025.

Pressure on heavy industries to reduce emissions is also translating into deployment of electric trucks, especially in heavily industrialised areas such as Hebei Province, where the fleet of electric trucks reached 30 000 vehicles. In 2024, Europe saw more than 10 000 electric trucks sold for the second year in a row, despite a lack of substantial incentives. Denmark, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and others saw significant growth, though this was partially offset by drops in electric truck sales in key markets such as France and the Netherlands. Global EV Outlook 2025 Trends in heavy-duty electric vehicles PAGE | 69 IEA. CC BY 4.0. In the United States, electric truck sales in 2024 were similar to in 2023. Nevertheless, the number of electric trucks sold in 2024 – over 1 700 – was more than the cumulative number of electric trucks sold in the country between 2015 and 2022. Electric truck sales in the United States were supported by a tax credit of up to USD 40 000, as well as project grants for vehicle purchases, charging infrastructure and other expenses through the nearly USD 1 billion Clean HeavyDuty Vehicles Grant Program. There were positive developments elsewhere in the world, such as in Brazil, where almost 500 electric trucks were sold in 2024, and in Canada, with almost 2 000 sales for the second year in a row. In addition, Japan, South Africa and Thailand saw their collective sales jump from around 130 to almost 900 between 2023 and 2024. India saw a decline in electric truck sales in 2024, but in September the PM E-DRIVE scheme allocated a budget of USD 58 million for purchase incentives for electric trucks over the next 2 years.

Certain niches are quickly being electrified, including in the heavy freight segment Deployment of electric trucks varies by application, as some duty cycles are more suited to electrification than others. Cycles with combinations of lower daily mileage, lower speeds, and predictable routes are typically easier to electrify, as seen at Manhattan Beer, which has begun to electrify its fleet.

Similarly, in India, UltraTech Cement have ordered 100 electric trucks to decarbonise a 400 km route between two of their operations, and orders for 180 electric trucks from Billion E-Mobility (including 45 with a gross vehicle weight of 55 tonnes) have spurred Ashok Leyland to increase their production capacity. In China, successful battery swapping trials have supported an increase in electric trucks in the concrete industry. Efforts to switch to electric trucks for delivery services are also spurring uptake and trials of new heavy truck models, where high mileages increase the potential cost benefits of electrification. In California, DHL recently tested the prototype of the Tesla Semi, which is expected to enter production in 2026, while in Germany, DHL deployed two Mercedes eActros 300s. Similarly, Amazon signed an order for more than 200 Mercedes eActros-600 electric trucks, which will be deployed in the United Kingdom and Germany with the goal of decarbonising high-mileage predictable routes, on which charging can be planned with a high degree of certainty.

Electric heavy-duty models The number of electric heavy-duty vehicle models reached almost 800 in 2024 The number of electric heavy-duty models available worldwide has continued to grow steadily, driven by increasing demand as battery costs have declined. The market with the most models available remains China, with almost 450 – more than half of which are electric buses. In the United States, over 140 models are available, around half of which are medium-duty truck models, while buses represent less than 30%. The prevalence of medium-duty models in the US market could suggest that fleet operators are prioritising the electrification of lower-cost vehicles that cover shorter routes before transitioning to long-haul applications. In Europe, there are about 150 electric heavy-duty models available, with a more even distribution across buses, medium-, and heavy-duty trucks. In Europe, truck OEMs are expanding their electric heavy-duty truck line-ups for regional-haul applications (<400 km), and improving performances for long-haul trucks amid increasing electric sales. In 2024, Volvo launched its latest electric truck, FH Electric, offering a range of 600 km, similar to the range offered by Scania’s latest electric truck model. On the other hand, OEMs such as Renault are targeting urban logistics. Global EV Outlook 2025 Trends in heavy-duty electric vehicles PAGE | 71 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Electric heavy-duty models are also becoming available in emerging markets. BAIC Foton has an electric truck on the market in Argentina, and German truck manufacturer TRATON has been producing their electric “e-Delivery” truck in Brazil since 2021 under the Volkswagen Caminhões e Ônibus brand. In 2024, BYD licensed Rêver to build electric buses and trucks based on BYD technologies in Thailand. Falling battery prices have been a key driver of growth in electric trucks. Since 2020, battery prices1 for commercial vehicles have dropped by 30%, enabling manufacturers to either extend vehicle range without increasing costs, or reduce costs to narrow the price gap between diesel and electric trucks. Between 2020 and 2024, the price of medium-duty electric truck battery packs increased only slightly, by almost 15%, despite battery size increasing by more than 60%. For heavy-duty trucks, battery pack size increased by around 70% between 2020 and 2024, but falling battery prices meant the rise in battery pack costs per vehicle was limited to less than 20% over the same period. Strategic partnerships between battery and commercial vehicle manufacturers, such as the agreement between CATL and FAW, seek to deliver even more affordable electric truck models through a more integrated supply chain.

Long-haul, heavy-duty trucks are often considered one of the hardest-to-electrify vehicle segments due to the need to balance battery size, range and payload constraints with charging requirements. In this section, we consider battery electric and fuel cell electric heavy-duty (HD) trucks, both of which have zero tailpipe emissions, and compare their TCO to diesel HD trucks in three major markets: China, the European Union and the United States.2 A daily driving distance of 500 km is assumed. The upfront cost of a battery electric truck was two to three times that of a diesel truck in 2024 While the TCO is important for overall business profitability, the upfront costs can be particularly important to small business that may have less access to financing. Small businesses make up the vast majority of hauliers in the United States (95%) and Europe (90%), and more than half in China (less than 70%),3 where the haulage industry has been experiencing increasing consolidation. Battery electric and fuel cell electric trucks are more expensive to purchase than conventional diesel trucks. This is mostly due to the batteries used in BEVs and the fuel cell stacks and hydrogen storage tanks in FCEVs being more expensive than equivalent diesel ICEV technologies. Today, for a truck with an 800 kWh battery (500 km range), the battery represents almost half of the upfront cost of a battery electric truck, and this is expected to fall to around 35% in 2030. For an FCEV, the battery, fuel cell system and hydrogen storage tank represent around half of the upfront cost today and this is not expected to change in 2030. The costs of batteries, fuel cells, and hydrogen storage tanks are expected to fall thanks to greater economies of scale and manufacturing learnings, driving down the capital costs of both BEVs and FCEVs. In the next 5 years, the purchase price of a battery electric HD truck could fall by around 15-35%, depending on the 2 Please see Annex A for full assumptions and costs used to calculate TCO in this section. 3 Due to differences in reporting across the sources, in the case of the United States a small business is defined as having up to 10 trucks, in Europe up to 9, whereas in China the equivalent number is 20 or under. Global EV Outlook 2025 Trends in heavy-duty electric vehicles PAGE | 73 IEA. CC BY 4.0. region. That of a fuel cell HD truck could fall 20-25%. However, both are expected to remain more expensive than diesel ICE trucks at the point of purchase. Purchase prices vary by region, and are lowest in China, primarily due to lower manufacturing and battery costs. Although the absolute price difference between battery electric and fuel cell electric trucks versus diesel equivalents is smallest in China, the low cost of diesel trucks means it has the largest relative price differences, at almost three (for battery electric) and four (for fuel cell electric) times the equivalent diesel price. The United States has the highest prices overall, while Europe enjoys both lower-cost diesel and zero-emissions trucks. Although not a like-for-like comparison, real-world price data shows that the premium for a zero-emissions truck was around USD 60 000 higher in the United States than in Europe in 2024, demonstrating the difficulties the United States is facing in achieving price competitiveness.

CC BY 4.0. years, vehicle efficiencies will likely improve by just 2-5%, meaning the levelised cost of fuel will remain a key component of TCO, especially for trucks with high daily driving distances. However, battery electric trucks are about 55% more energy-efficient than diesel heavy-duty trucks of the same size, while fuel cell electric trucks are about 30% more efficient. As such, based on 2024 fuel prices, the direct fuel costs associated with operating a battery electric heavy-duty truck are almost 70% lower than the diesel equivalent in China, and about one-third lower in the European Union and the United States. However, unlike diesel, both BEVs and FCEVs require the buildout of new, relatively expensive infrastructure, which adds to the fuel costs. Further, the levelised cost of both EV chargers and hydrogen refuelling stations (HRSs) is highly affected by utilisation rates. Overall, truck charging infrastructure could reach even higher levels of utilisation than LDV chargers, given that logistics operations are typically planned according to a predetermined schedule. Increasing the utilisation rate of an EV charger from 5% to 30% lowers the levelised infrastructure cost per kWh by about 80%, which would cut the overall fuel cost per kilometre by half based on 2024 prices. Increasing utilisation of en route chargers even further is possible, but may require solutions such as adaptive route planning. While a single HRS is more costly to build than a charging point, it can serve a large number of trucks daily without the local grid impacts of high-powered chargers. As the utilisation rises from 30% to 80%, the hydrogen cost premium for infrastructure investment payment drops by nearly 60%, resulting in a 25% drop in overall fuel cost per kilometre. However, even at higher utilisation rates, such as for captive fleets (i.e. that are owned by the operators and return to depot) or on busy public routes, the energy plus infrastructure cost per kilometre remains about 5% higher than EV charging at low utilisation rates, and double the cost of EV charging at high utilisation rates. For every USD 1 million spent on infrastructure, a highly utilised 350 kW charger covers more than twice as many vehicle kilometres as a highly utilised HRS. In addition, HRSs may present a greater barrier to entry, as they cannot be easily phased in gradually: an investment in HRSs must be accompanied by a large investment in FCEVs to avoid prohibitive per-vehicle fuel and infrastructure costs. On the other hand, chargers can be built modularly and more easily scaled as the fleet grows, beginning with depot charging, with en route high-powered charging following later to enable a greater share of journeys to be electrified. Policies such as the EU Renewable Energy Directive, California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, or China’s multiple cross-cutting policies promote reductions in emissions associated with electricity and hydrogen production, but can also impact the future fuel costs.

Battery electric trucks become competitive for long-haul applications this decade in China and Europe For a diesel HD truck that travels an average 500 km per day, the truck capital cost represents only around 10% of the TCO across China, Europe and the United States. That means that outside of relatively fixed costs such as driver costs, insurance and maintenance, diesel fuel costs dominate the TCO. In comparison, for an 800 kWh battery electric truck, the cost of the truck represents about 20-25% of the TCO, demonstrating the potential trade-off between high upfront costs and lower running costs. For battery electric trucks, energy costs account for around 15-25% of the TCO, and for fuel cell trucks they account for 15-35%, across the three regions examined. For BEVs, more than 10% of the TCO can be attributed to charging infrastructure in Europe and the United States, 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 350 kW 1 000 kW 2 500 kg/day 4 000 kg/day Diesel refuelling station Electric vehicle charging station Hydrogen refuelling station USD/km Fuel High infrastructure utilisation Low infrastructure utilisation Global EV Outlook 2025 Trends in heavy-duty electric vehicles PAGE | 76 IEA. CC BY 4.0. while in China, this share is reduced to around 3%, thanks to lower industrial land costs as well as lower capital costs. The refuelling infrastructure for fuel cell trucks has higher costs, representing nearly 10% of the TCO in China and more than 15% in Europe and the United States. In terms of operations, regulations on truck driver rest periods can play a role in determining the cost of the “dwell” time for recharging electric truck batteries. The time associated with charging is often considered to be a barrier to the adoption of battery electric trucks for long-haul applications as it can potentially disrupt operations, especially in very long-haul applications. This consideration is factored into the TCO calculation by adding the additional labour cost for the truck driver. In the European Union, drivers are required to take a 45-minute break every 4.5 hours. In the United States, a driver is not permitted to drive for more than 8 hours without a 30-minute break. In China, drivers are required to take a break every 4 hours, generally 20 minutes. As such, driving regulations can influence the TCO, and making use of rest periods for charging can make battery electric trucks more or less cost-competitive with diesel trucks. Based on a 500 km daily route and current regulations, an extra 15 (European Union), 30 (United States), and 40 minutes (China) would be needed in addition to the driver rest period in order to charge the battery electric HD truck sufficiently.4 The net cost associated with dwell time represents a trade-off between the fuel and labour costs, and as such may make more economic sense in China, where diesel is more expensive than in other regions, and labour and electricity less expensive. In contrast, in the United States, lower costs for diesel and higher labour and electricity costs can make it more difficult to justify. Charger power is also key in calculating this trade-off. A 350 kW charger, as used in the base case, can provide 200 km of range in around 1 hour, while a 1 MW charger could provide the same in about 20 minutes, potentially eliminating the dwell cost.5 Destination charging, particularly where drivers must wait for loading and unloading, could also greatly reduce the dwell time.

The impact on payload is another consideration for many hauliers. In the United States, 18% of trucks operate close to the general maximum gross vehicle weight, with a further 7% operating above the limit, meaning they could be impacted by the additional weight of either a fuel cell or battery electric truck compared to diesel. Derogations exist in the United States (907 kg) and the European Union (2 000 kg) to help offset the impact of the additional weight. A proposal from the European Commission to further increase this to 4 000 kg could eliminate the disadvantage relative to diesel trucks, but could also marginally 4 500 km daily distance is split evenly before and after the minimum rest periods of 20, 30, and 45 minutes in China, the United States, and the European Union, respectively, based on the driver’s rest regulations for each country/region, after which drivers, if required, continue to use the 350 kW charger to provide sufficient range to perform the same daily mileage day after day, including for overnight depot charging, based on 2024 fuel economy values and minimum and maximum battery states of charge of 20% and 80%. 5 Assuming 1.6 kWh/km fuel economy, and considering that this is below the length of the shortest minimum rest period.

This reflects the lower cost of EV batteries in China, as well as the gap in fuel costs, as electricity already costs 65% less than diesel per kilometre. As such, energy costs for battery electric trucks are over 50% lower per kilometre compared to diesel trucks. Fuel cell trucks remained around 35% more expensive than diesel trucks in China in 2024, largely because of the higher infrastructure and fuel costs for hydrogen.

Compared to the European Union, US regulations on driver rest periods and maximum gross vehicle weight further hamper the uptake of zero-emissions trucks. However, in the coming years, the TCO of battery and fuel cell electric trucks is expected to fall due to improvements in infrastructure utilisation and costs, as well as further cost reductions for batteries and fuel cells. In contrast, diesel electric trucks are expected to become more expensive due to more stringent pollutant emissions regulation. In all three markets, fuel cell trucks remain more expensive than battery electric trucks up to 2030, while continued development of high-powered charging – especially megawatt charging – reduces or eliminates the refuelling time advantage offered by FCEVs compared to BEVs. Increased utilisation of HRSs could result in further reductions to the TCO of fuel cell electric trucks, but battery electric trucks will remain cheaper to operate. For fuel cell electric trucks to become more competitive, substantial reductions in the capital costs of the truck and infrastructure, as well as lower fuel costs, will be necessary. In 2030, the TCO of battery electric trucks is more competitive than diesel trucks in both China and the European Union. The gap also narrows substantially in the United States, achieving parity around 2030. Incentives such as grants towards the purchase of trucks, chargers, or HRSs, or differentiated taxes and charges could bring this date even closer, or indeed allow TCO parity to be achieved today in applications particularly suited to electrification.

In comparison, the stock of EVs exceeded 60 million (excluding 2/3Ws) at the end of 2024, about 600 times the number of FCEVs. About 70% of the FCEVs on the road are cars, though this share has fallen since the end of 2023 (75%).

Growth in fuel cell car sales has slowed in recent years, with just 5 000 sold worldwide in 2024, compared to the peak of more than 16 000 in 2021. This slowdown is particularly acute in the United States and Korea – the two countries with the largest stocks of fuel cell cars.

In 2024, the stock of fuel cell trucks in China increased 40% compared to 2023, reaching almost 15 000 vehicles, about 5 times the amount at the end of 2020. In addition, the stock of fuel cell LCVs in China reached more than 5 000 by the end of 2024, nearly double that of the previous year. Almost 95% of the world’s fuel cell commercial vehicles are in China. Around 50 fuel cell commercial vehicle models were available worldwide in 2024. Over 60% of these were heavy-duty truck models, coming from 20 different manufacturers. However, Nikola, one of the pioneers of heavy-duty fuel cell trucks, filed for bankruptcy in February 2025, despite selling 200 vehicles in 2024 and securing orders for 100 more meant to be delivered in 2025. To support the growing number of FCEVs, countries have supported the buildout of hydrogen refuelling stations (HRSs). The number of operational stations reached around 1 300 worldwide at the end of 2024, 15% more than at the end of 2023. The largest growth occurred in China, where the number of HRSs increased 30% in 2024 to reach more than 500. In Europe, the number of stations increased 15% to over 300 by the end of 2024, despite some closures in countries such as Denmark and the United Kingdom. The United States and Korea have also seen the number of available HRSs fluctuate over the past year or so, as hydrogen supply and station reliability issues have led to temporary and permanent closures.

It includes current EV-related policies and announcements, regulations and investments, as well as market trends based on the expected impacts of technology developments, announced deployments and plans from industry stakeholders. The STEPS aims to hold up a mirror to the plans of policy makers and illustrate their consequences. The projections for EV markets in this year’s Global EV Outlook (GEVO-25) are limited to 2030 in the STEPS. As the IEA highlighted in its 2024 edition of Energy Technology Perspectives, energy, industrial and trade policies are increasingly interwoven and there are challenges and trade-offs between these key areas of public policy. The way these interactions play out for electric mobility over the longer term will therefore be assessed holistically in the context of the scenarios of the entire global energy system that the IEA will develop later in the year using its Global Energy and Climate Model (GEC-M). Key uncertainties for EV markets for the medium-term – such as those related to the evolution of trade and industrial policy, downside risks to the economic outlook and the impact of different levels of oil prices – are, however, presented in this chapter of the report. The projections in the STEPS in GEVO-2025 consider historical market data and stated policies up until the end of February 2025. These scenario projections incorporate GDP assumptions from the International Monetary Fund and population assumptions from the United Nations, as described in the 2024 GEC-M documentation.

Vehicle outlook by mode The global electric vehicle fleet grows fourfold to 2030 under stated policies By 2030, the fleet of EVs across all modes except 2/3Ws reaches 250 million in the STEPS – four times as many EVs as there were at the end of 2024. More than 90% are electric cars, which is similar to the share in 2024. In this scenario, the stock of EVs (excluding 2/3Ws) increases at an average rate of about 25% per year, which is about half the annual growth observed from 2018-2024. In 2024, the stock of electric 2/3Ws was higher than that of all other EVs combined. By 2030, however, the stock of electric cars overtakes that of electric 2/3Ws, despite the latter more than doubling to reach around 170 million in 2030 in the STEPS. As a result, EVs represent about 15% of all vehicles on the road (including 2/3Ws) in 2030 in this scenario. The share of global EV stock in China decreases from over 70% in 2024 to around 55% in 2030 in the STEPS as adoption in other markets grows.

Economic and policy uncertainties could impact car markets and the global outlook for EVs The recent surge in trade policies and tariffs may affect the price and resulting sales of EVs – especially electric cars – in several markets over the coming years. In particular, in March 2025 the United States announced an additional 25% tariff applicable to all automobiles, including electric cars, and to certain components. In 2024, 40% of electric cars sold in the United States (over 600 000) were imported, with over 10% of them coming from Europe and slightly less than 10% each coming from Mexico, Japan and Korea. Conventional car sales are more exposed, with over half of all conventional cars sold in the United States in 2024 having been imported.

CC BY 4.0. countries as EVs, although there is a much higher reliance on Mexico and lower reliance on Europe. As a result, the impact of tariffs on the sales share of electric cars in the United States may be relatively small compared to the impact of potential changes in demand-side policies (such as fuel economy standards and tax incentives), some of which are already considered as part of the STEPS outlook. The impact of tariffs might be more pronounced for EV batteries, their components and raw materials, all of which are highly traded across the world because supply is significantly more concentrated than demand. China produces the cheapest EV batteries, and was responsible for nearly 80% of global EV battery cell production in 2024. China’s share of production was even higher for battery components, for which the country represented almost 85% of global cathode active material and over 90% of the anode active material production. A global shift towards higher tariffs could put upward pressure on battery prices, counteracting some of the significant battery price declines that have occurred since 2015. For example, a 25% tariff would override the 20% average battery price declines from the past year. However, countries across the world are simultaneously developing and improving the competitiveness of their local battery manufacturing industries, which is expected to contribute to narrowing regional cost gaps. Emerging trade tensions also have implications for the economic outlook, which may create additional uncertainty for the EV outlook. In April 2025, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) released revised GDP projections, which show 2.8% growth globally in 2025 and 3% growth in 2026, as compared to 3.3% in both years in their January 2025 projections. The revisions to GDP growth were most pronounced in North America, with projected 2025 growth for the United States falling from 2.7% previously to 1.8% in the April 2025 update. The IMF now projects in its central scenario that in the United States and China, two of the largest EV markets in the world, GDP growth in 2025 will be one percentage point lower than in 2024. By 2027, the IMF expects global GDP growth to return back to levels previously projected, though for advanced economies as a whole, annual GDP growth projections remain lower through 2029 compared to the IMF’s October 2024 publication. Lower GDP growth could add pressure on already-strained government budgets, which, in turn, could lead to governments downscaling or terminating incentive schemes for EVs ahead of schedule. While direct subsidies are already quite small in most major markets, indirect subsidies, such as those related to company cars, could be affected. Similarly, budgets allocated to the deployment of charging infrastructure at different administrative levels (from national to local levels of government) could be reduced. While all these factors could slow down"}

While all these factors could slow down the uptake of EVs, policy responses can also be developed in a way that supports EV sales, as was done in European countries in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Global EV Outlook 2025 Outlook for electric mobility PAGE | 86 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Lower economic growth and the corresponding effects on the purchasing power of consumers could slow down sales of new vehicles across all powertrain types, thereby potentially counterbalancing the impact on EV sales shares. Evidence shows that an economic slowdown can affect car sales. For example, pronounced and abrupt economic crises have led to double digit declines in car sales in the past, for example in the United States between 2007 and 2009 (GDP -2.5%, car sales -37%), and in Italy between 2011 and 2013 (GDP -5%, car sales -25%). More modest and gradual economic slowdowns can also have an effect, such as the slowdown in China between 2017 and 2019 (+6.2 % compared to a ten-year average of over +8%) that led to the first decline in car sales recorded in decades, of -12% over 2 years. The extent to which car markets – and, as part of that, electric car sales – might be affected by a sluggish economic outlook is still uncertain. The Chinese market will be key to watch: it is the largest single car market in the world, and it drives the outlook for global electric car sales in the medium term, accounting for more than half of global electric car sales through 2030 in the STEPS. In China, electric cars are already price competitive with conventional cars and so there is little reason to believe that electric car sales would be more affected by an economic slowdown than conventional cars. Further, China’s extension of its vehicle tradein policy may also contribute to keeping overall car sales strong. Even if car sales volumes in China are lower than is projected in the STEPS, electric car sales shares are likely to remain relatively robust. Finally, changes in energy prices can also affect the adoption of EVs. Weak demand prospects have led to a drop in global oil prices from an average of around USD 80 per barrel in 2024 to below USD 60 per barrel at one point in April 2025. Lower oil prices, if sustained, could translate into lower retail prices for gasoline and diesel, thus reducing the economic incentive to purchase EVs, all else being equal. The impact of such a drop is likely to vary across regions: it will be more moderate in regions with high fuel taxation (such as the European Union), and more pronounced in regions with lower fuel taxation, such as the United States and China. Nonetheless, oil prices would need to be extremely low to completely offset the savings offered by the lower running costs of EVs. Taking oil prices around USD 40 per barrel as an illustrative example, there are significant savings to be made in all major markets from running a battery electric car if it is charged at home. In China, even at such a low oil price, battery electric cars remain cheaper to run when charged at public fast chargers due to a combination of low electricity prices and high charging infrastructure utilisation rates. In the United States, the vast majority of electric car owners have access to home charging, but public fast charging can be expensive compared to gasoline. In the European Union, most EV owners also have access to home chargers, though to a lesser extent. Low oil prices could therefore undermine the economic case for EVs for drivers without access to home charging depending on the speed and thus cost of public charging.

CC BY 4.0. Market momentum in China sees electric cars reach a sales share of around 80% by the end of the decade In the second half of 2024, China achieved the milestone of an electric car sales share of more than 50%, partly thanks to the cost competitiveness of EVs. For the past few years, over half of the electric cars sold in China have been cheaper than ICE cars of the same size, and as battery prices continue to fall, this trend is likely to continue. Based on stated policies, the share of electric cars and vans in China is expected to reach around 80% of total sales in 2030, backed by continuing policy support and progress on affordability. China has already exceeded the official government target of reaching a sales share of 45% of new energy vehicles (NEV) among new cars by 2027, underscoring the strong market dynamics behind the shift to electromobility. Trade-in grants that were due to expire at the end of 2024 have been extended to 2025, and the NEV exemption from vehicle purchase tax has also been extended until the end of 2027, further supporting uptake of EVs in the short term. In addition, government plans to enhance charging infrastructure over the period to 2030 aim to keep pace with EV uptake by promoting the construction of charging stations in residential areas, as well as in parking spaces in enterprises, industrial parks and government buildings. Policy action to restrict ICE 2/3Ws in several cities over the past decade has driven high adoption rates of electric 2/3Ws, with more than 30% of 2/3Ws now electric. In the STEPS, the share of electric 2/3Ws on the road reaches nearly 50% by 2030, driven by the continued momentum of electromobility in China and a further decline in battery costs. This growing trend also extends to buses, especially in cities, where nearly all new buses are now electric. However, the electric market share of coaches for intercity transport was below 10% in 2024. By 2030 in the STEPS, the sales share of electric buses reaches almost 75% across all bus segments, up from less than two-thirds today. China currently accounts for more than 80% of electric medium- and heavy-duty truck sales worldwide, and the sales share in the country increased to more than 4% in 2024, from 2% in 2023. In some months, the sales share of battery-electric heavy trucks reached a new high of almost 15%, as seen in late June. Truck manufacturers are making efforts to reduce costs, such as by adopting the less costly lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery chemistry. In addition, policy support for HDV charging infrastructure and the increasing availability of battery-swapcapable vehicles could further accelerate electrification in this segment.

European policy environment continues to promote EVs while offering some flexibility in the short term Electric car sales stagnated in Europe in 2024, due to a mix of factors including reduced availability of purchase subsidies and a lack of affordable mass-market EV models in OEMs line-ups, as well as sluggish car markets in general. Nonetheless, the policy environment in Europe is one of the strongest in terms of support for EVs, which could encourage strong growth in electric LDV sales over the remainder of this decade. OEMs are beginning to introduce more competitively priced models to comply with the new phase of EU CO2 standards, which entered into force in 2025. The 2025-2029 EU fleet-wide CO2 targets that were originally proposed represent a 15% emissions reduction compared to a 2021 baseline. The stringency of the standard is further bolstered by two changes in the way CO2 emissions are calculated starting from 2025. First, the utility factor (the share of distance driven in electric mode only) of new PHEV models, which is used to calculate their official CO2 emission values, decreases, meaning PHEV sales are now less effective in helping OEMs reach target compliance. Second, the revised calculation of CO2 emission targets will be more favourable to smaller, lighter OEM fleets, potentially increasing the challenge for manufacturers of heavier models. As a response to concerns that compliance would be difficult for some European manufacturers, the European Commission recently published an Industrial Action Plan for the European automotive sector, which announced a proposal to offer flexibilities in meeting the 2025 CO2 standards for cars and vans. This allows OEMs to reach target compliance by averaging their emissions over the period 2025-27, rather than needing to reach the target by the end of 2025. Despite giving more leeway to carmakers to fall in line with their CO2 targets, the Action Plan has reaffirmed the overall impetus towards the 2030 and 2035 targets. It was also announced that the review of the 2035 targets would be sped up, with full technology neutrality as a core principle, though the outcome and thus impact on EV shares remains to be seen. Global EV Outlook 2025 Outlook for electric mobility PAGE | 90 IEA. CC BY 4.0. The European Union is also exploring measures to accelerate the adoption of zero-emission vehicles in corporate fleets, which currently account for around 60% of new car sales. Policies to support EV uptake in EU member states include national-level measures such as tax credits for EV company cars in countries including Belgium, or France’s \"social leasing” schemes for low-income households, which will be rerun in 2025. When considered alongside the zero emission vehicle mandate in the United Kingdom, stated policies drive the sales share of electric cars and vans in Europe to nearly 60% by 2030 in the STEPS, up from less than 20% today. For buses and medium- and heavy-duty trucks, the EU HDV CO2 standards serve as the key lever for further electrification. Policy momentum is particularly strong for electric buses in the European Union, and their share in total bus sales reaches around two-thirds by 2030 in the STEPS. For medium- and heavy-freight trucks, policies already in place towards meeting the EU CO2 standards result in around one-third of new registrations in the European Union being electric by 2030 in the STEPS. The European Commission’s proposal to exempt zero-emission trucks from road tolls could further support this trend. Toll charges for a long-haul diesel truck can amount to EUR 25 000 annually. Across Europe as a whole, the share of electric medium- and heavy-duty trucks in this scenario is around 25% in 2030, reflecting the varying levels of policy support across different countries. In Europe, EV sales across all vehicle types (excluding 2/3Ws) are projected to exceed 55% by 2030 in the STEPS, with lighter vehicles such as passenger cars and light commercial vehicles making up the majority of sales.

Recent US policy directs the government to reduce support for EVs On 20 January 2025, Executive Order 14154 declared that it was US policy to, among other things, eliminate subsidies and other policy measures influencing markets in favour of EVs. Following this, a bill was introduced to the US Senate that proposes to repeal the Clean Vehicle Tax Credit for both electric cars and commercial vehicles. In addition, the US Secretary of Transportation has directed the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to review existing fuel economy standards for LDVs. The fuel economy standards that were finalised in 2024 require the fuel economy of passenger cars to improve around 2% per year for model years 2027-2031. While emissions from vehicles are typically regulated at the federal level under the Clean Air Act, in December 2024, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) granted California’s request for a waiver from federal pre-emption (by which federal law supersedes conflicting state law) for their Advanced Clean Cars II Global EV Outlook 2025 Outlook for electric mobility PAGE | 91 IEA. CC BY 4.0. (ACC-II) regulation. The ACC-II regulation requires an increasing number of electric and fuel cell electric new car sales, from 35% in 2026 to 100% in 2035 and beyond. In 2024, California represented almost 30% of US electric car sales, but only around 10% of total US car sales. In addition to California, 11 other states and Washington DC have adopted the ACC-II regulation under Section 177 of the Clean Air Act. All together, the states that have adopted the ACC-II regulation represent about 30% of all US LDV sales. However, Executive Order 14154 also directed US policy to terminate, “where appropriate, state emissions waivers that function to limit sales of gasoline-powered automobiles.” Based on stated policy intentions, electric LDV sales in the United States increase from about 10% today to about 20% in 2030 in the STEPS. To put this in context, in the STEPS of GEVO24, US electric car sales reached more than 50% in 2030, on the back of policies in support of EVs. The availability and stringency of fuel economy and emissions standards also has significant implications for HDV electrification prospects in the United States. In April 2023, the US EPA granted a waiver of pre-emption for California’s Advanced Clean Trucks (ACT) Regulation, which requires that manufacturers produce and sell increasing quantities of medium- and heavy-duty near-zero and zero-emission vehicles. Ten states have since adopted the ACT regulation. On the other hand, California withdrew its request for a waiver of pre-emption for the Advanced Clean Fleets (ACF) Regulation, which would have required certain fleet owners to purchase increasing shares of near-zero and zero-emission trucks. Some elements of the ACF Regulation would not have been affected by the waiver and so state and local government fleets will still be required to comply with the regulation. At the federal level, in March 2024, the US EPA released final emissions standards for HDVs, which require CO2 emissions reductions (per tonmile) of about 25-60% for model year 2032 trucks compared to model year 2027, depending on truck type. Given uncertainty in the longevity of the existing emissions standards and state waivers, the sales share of electric medium- and heavy-duty trucks in the United States reaches around 8% in 2030 in the STEPS, up from less than half a percent in 2024. This compares to 20% electric truck sales projected in 2030 in the STEPS of GEVO-24. Electric bus deployment has historically been supported at the federal level through funding opportunities such as the Clean School Bus Program, but city and state policy also play a role in driving uptake, meaning that electric buses may be relatively insulated from changes to federal policies. For example, the Illinois State Legislature passed law that transit agencies in the state can purchase only zeroemission buses from 2026. The California state government also offers incentives for the purchase of buses and dedicated charging infrastructure, such as the Global EV Outlook 2025 Outlook for electric mobility PAGE | 92 IEA. CC BY 4.0. USD 500 million allocated to school buses during the 2023-2024 fiscal year. In the STEPS, EVs represent close to 15% of bus sales in 2030, up from about 3% in 2024.

Across all vehicle types, excluding 2/3Ws, EVs represent one in five vehicles sold in the United States in 2030 in the STEPS, meaning one in thirteen vehicles on the road in 2030 is electric. This is about half the sales share across the rest of the world, where around 40% of vehicle sales (excluding 2/3Ws) are electric in 2030 in the STEPS. Strong domestic industry, fuel economy standards and targeted subsidies support EV growth in Japan The policy framework in Japan has remained fairly stable over the past year. In 2019, the country published LDV fuel economy targets for 2030, aiming to achieve an improvement of 32% in fuel economy by 2030 compared to 2016. This 11-year lead time has given automakers time to incorporate the fuel economy standards in their company strategies, and the seven largest Japanese automakers now all have electrification targets in place. In addition, purchase subsidies are available for electric and fuel cell cars to help achieve the country’s net zero and Green Transformation target of 100% electrified (including fuel cell and hybrid) car sales by 2035. In the STEPS, Japan’s electric LDV sales increase from 3% of total LDV sales in 2024 to 20% by 2030. This is in line with the low end of the range described in Japan’s Next-Generation Vehicle Strategy, which aims for a 20-30% sales share of electric LDVs by 2030, with another 30-40% sales being hybrids, and 3% being fuel cell LDVs. Fuel economy standards for HDVs, including buses and trucks, require a reduction in fuel consumption of more than 13% in 2025 compared to the 2015 baseline. Japan also has purchase subsidies in place for buses and trucks to support EV and FCEV uptake. Electric bus sales reach about 12% in 2030 in the STEPS, up from 2% in 2024. Electric medium and heavy freight truck sales are slow but rise from less than 0.5% today to around 10% by the end of the decade. Japan is steadily moving towards the electrification of 2/3Ws, with electric 2/3Ws already accounting for 7% of sales in 2024. This is further supported by city-level policies, such as Tokyo’s subsidies for eligible 2/3Ws, which have been introduced with the aim of all new sales being electric by 2035. The share of electric 2/3Ws continues to rise in the STEPS, reaching more than 45% by 2030. Japan’s EV sales share across all modes (excluding 2/3Ws) was at 3% in 2024 and increases to nearly 20% by 2030 in the STEPS, and just slightly over 20% when including 2/3Ws. As a result, about 1 in 20 vehicles in Japan is electric in 2030 based on stated policies. Global EV Outlook 2025 Outlook for electric mobility PAGE | 93 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Policy support in India focuses on the electrification of vehicles other than cars Following years of support under the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme, which was introduced in 2015, implementation of the new PM Electric Drive Revolution in Innovative Vehicle Enhancement (PM E-DRIVE) scheme began on 1 October 2024. The new scheme focuses on electric 2/3Ws, buses, trucks and charging infrastructure, while specifically excluding electric cars, and has a budget envelope of USD 1.3 billion to 31 March 2026. The 2/3W segment is already the most electrified segment in India, with close to 10% of sales in 2024 being electric. This high electrification rate has been driven by the significant savings on total cost of ownership (TCO) offered by existing electric 2/3W models in India. As early as 2023, we estimated that, with subsidies in place, the TCO of an average electric 2W would be 40% less than its ICE equivalent after 5 years of ownership. The combination of policy support and advantageous economics mean that momentum in electric 2/3W sales is set to continue, and electric models are expected to account for more than one-third of 2/3W sales by 2030 in the STEPS. Although there are no purchase subsidies for electric cars in India, other mechanisms may support adoption. These include the national vehicle scrapping policy (V-VMP), along with a number of federal and state-level policies, such as a reduction in the rate of the federal Good and Services Tax and in the Regional Transport Office state-level tax, as well as other registration and road tax waivers. In addition, the government’s Production"}

In addition, the government’s Production Linked Incentive scheme for Automobile and Auto Components and for manufacturing of Advanced Chemistry Cell Battery Storage aims to attract investments in domestic EV and battery manufacturing. In March 2024, the government approved the Scheme to Promote Manufacturing of Electric Passenger Cars in India to attract investment from global EV manufacturers. This allows EV manufacturers committing to invest in India to import electric cars with import duties reduced from 70% (or 100% if the purchase price exceeds USD 50 000) to 15%. These policies in support of domestic manufacturing are well-poised to help drive EV uptake. The Indian Government is currently drafting new CO2 emissions standards for cars, CAFE III (2027-2032) and CAFE IV (2033-2037), which have proposed WLTP CO2 emission targets of 91.7 g CO2/km and 70 g CO2/km, respectively. This standard will be implemented with a super-credit mechanism, making it easier for OEMs to reach compliance through electric car sales rather than through sales of conventional cars and non-plug-in hybrids. Based on existing policy support Global EV Outlook 2025 Outlook for electric mobility PAGE | 94 IEA. CC BY 4.0. (excluding the latest CAFE III and IV proposals which are still at the consultation stage), sales of electric cars increase from 2% in 2024 to almost 15% in 2030 in the STEPS. In October 2024, the government of India also adopted the PM e-Bus Sewa-PSM Scheme to support the roll-out of 38 000 electric buses across the country, with a budget of INR 34.4 billion (USD 394 million). When considered alongside the support from the PM E-DRIVE scheme, electric bus sales reach 25% in 2030 in the STEPS, up from less than 6% in 2024. Electrification of other heavy vehicles, namely freight trucks, is expected to proceed less quickly, due to greater price barriers. Electric truck sales reach around 2% in 2030 in the STEPS, which is similar to India’s 2024 EV sales share for cars. Across all vehicle modes, excluding 2/3Ws, EVs represent 1 in 8 vehicles sold in India in 2030 in the STEPS, up from less than 1 in 50 in 2024. When 2/3Ws are included, stated policies imply that the electrification rate increases to one in three vehicles sold by 2030. EV sales in Southeast Asia approach 30% of all vehicle sales in 2030 under today’s policy settings Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s second-largest car market, has introduced a range of policies to meet its ambitious EV targets. One of the key incentives was the introduction in April 2023 of a VAT discount on EV sales, which is continuing in 2025. In addition, EV manufacturing and trade policies currently provide import duty exemptions for EVs made by manufacturers committing to establish domestic manufacturing facilities by 2026. Under stated policies, the electric car sales share reaches 25% by 2030, up from 9% in 2024. This translates into a stock of almost 1 million electric cars in 2030 in the STEPS, which is still less than half of the government’s target of 2 million. The country has also set the target of 13 million electric motorcycles by 2030. Based on recent market trends, the EV share of 2/3W sales in Indonesia increases from less than 2% in 2024 to 30% in 2030. Despite this strong growth, the total stock of electric 2/3Ws is less than the government target for electric motorcycles. Several other Southeast Asian countries have recently adopted manufacturing and trade policies to facilitate EV imports while also developing domestic EV manufacturing. In most of these countries, such policy developments are accompanied by measures to support EV uptake. In Malaysia, for example, the largest car market in the region in 2024, electric cars are exempt from import duties, registration and road taxes until the end of 2025, and until 2027 if locally built. Thailand, Southeast Asia’s third-largest car market in 2024, implemented a set of measures called the EV 3.5 Policy to support the roll-out of electric passenger cars, pick-up trucks and motorcycles. This new scheme, adopted in Global EV Outlook 2025 Outlook for electric mobility PAGE | 95 IEA.

The Thai government will establish new purchase subsidies and road tax exemptions until 2027 under the new framework, including some incentives also for hybrid vehicles, along with waivers on import duties for OEMs committing to produce EVs domestically. The Philippines, Viet Nam and Singapore have also adopted policies to reduce import duties, exempt EVs from excise taxes, or set up EV mandates to further support the adoption of EVs in the region. The outlook for EV sales in Southeast Asia is bright, thanks to its emerging role as a manufacturing hub, and the existing set of manufacturing, trade and demandside policies supporting the electrification of road transport. Under stated policies, electric car sales in Southeast Asia are likely to reach 25% of total car sales by 2030. Other vehicle modes are also expected to make significant strides in electrification, with electric 2/3Ws surpassing a 30% sales share and electric buses nearing 15%. Overall, across all vehicle segments, the EV sales share in Southeast Asia approaches 30% in 2030 in the STEPS. Policy support in Latin America means electric bus sales could increase more than tenfold by 2030 Countries in Latin America have been increasing their policy support for EVs, especially since 2020. In particular, Brazil, Colombia and Chile stand out for passing legislation to promote EVs. This is important for the EV outlook in the region as together, these three countries represent almost half of Latin America’s car and bus sales. In 2024, Brazil approved the MOVER programme, which incentivises private sector investment in the R&D and manufacturing of sustainable vehicle technologies including EVs. Colombia also has relevant legislation, particularly to encourage the electrification of public buses, including a law that requires cities with mass transportation systems to ensure that electric or zero-emission vehicle sales increase from 10% in 2025 to 100% in 2035. In 2024, the government also created the Fund for the Promotion of Technological Advancement, which among other things will support electric LDV sales by covering the price differential with ICEVs. In 2024, new LDV fuel economy standards came into effect in Chile. These promote zero-emission vehicles by offering credit multipliers. Other countries in Latin America also offer policy support for EVs, mainly in the form of tax incentives. Electric car sales in Latin America increased from 0.3% in 2020 to around 4% in 2024, and reach around 13% in 2030 in the STEPS. Latin America has also seen success in deploying electric buses, which is expected to continue: in 2030 in the STEPS, electric bus sales reach almost 14%, up from 2% in 2024. Global EV Outlook 2025 Outlook for electric mobility PAGE | 96 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Automakers’ electrification announcements Near- and mid-term automaker electrification targets are increasingly uncertain A number of automakers have scaled back their near-term targets for EVs over the past year, citing lower-than-expected consumer demand, and in the context of difficulties in achieving profitability with BEVs for many non-Chinese OEMs. Many, if not all, had previously set those targets with a degree of flexibility dependent on market conditions. The shifting policy landscape in some markets further increases uncertainty in automaker electrification targets out to 2030, though the outlook for electric car sales remains robust. General Motors (GM) – the best-selling carmaker in the United States – missed its goal of producing and wholesaling 200 000 EVs in North America in 2024 by about 5%. The company expects to produce up to 300 000 EVs in 2025, and is no longer reiterating its previous target of reaching an annual production capacity of 1 million EVs by the end of 2025. Similarly, Tesla – the best-selling electric carmaker in the United States – dropped the goal of selling 20 million cars per year by 2030 from its 2023 annual impact report, despite this target having been included in consecutive previous reports. The uncertainty around whether Tesla will still aim to sell 20 million electric cars worldwide in 2030 has a significant impact on the range of OEM electrification targets in all of the major markets. In 2021, Ford, GM and Stellantis released a joint statement announcing their aspiration to achieve sales"}

In 2021, Ford, GM and Stellantis released a joint statement announcing their aspiration to achieve sales of 40-50% electric or fuel cell electric cars in the United States by 2030, in line with the Biden administration’s target. Given the change of administration in the United States, the future commitment to these targets is unclear. As such, the range of OEM declarations for electric car sales in the United States in 2030 now stretches from 70% electric car sales in 2030 to less than 30%; a year ago the lower end of the range of OEM declarations in the United States was around 50%. In spite of this, even if only the lower end of the OEM target range were to be achieved, the electric car sales share in the United States would almost triple by 2030.

The range today reflects OEM announcements as of the end of Q1 2025. The relative market share of OEMs is held constant unless the OEM has EV volume targets rather than sales share targets. Sources: IEA analysis based on company announcements and data from EV Volumes and Marklines. With regards to the European market, Ford has abandoned its goal to shift entirely to electric sales in Europe by 2030, though in 2024 Ford was responsible for less than 5% of car sales in the region. Volvo Cars, also representing less than 5% of car sales in Europe, has also scaled down its 2030 all-electric target, allowing for up to 10% of its sales to be hybrids. Similarly, Renault had previously aimed for 100% of its car sales to be electric in Europe by 2030, but in 2024 its CEO announced that a two-pronged approach of selling both ICE and electric cars will continue for the next decade. Nevertheless, the range of OEM electrification targets for Europe remains the highest of the major EV markets, reaching from over 60% to around 85% of car sales in 2030. In contrast, as Chinese EV sales remained strong over 2024, BYD surpassed its 2024 sales target, which had already been increased from 3.6 million new energy vehicles (i.e. EVs and FCEVs) to 4 million. In total, BYD represented about 15% of car sales in China; all-electric car brands (including Tesla, Li Auto, NIO and others) together represented one-quarter of car sales in China in 2024. As a result of the growing success of all-electric car brands, the EV sales shares in China in 2030 based on OEM targets has increased, despite there being no new targets for 2030.

Electric vehicle charging Charging electric light-duty vehicles Public chargers have doubled since 2022 to reach more than 5 million Access to public charging points is key to supporting mass adoption Home charging remains the most popular way to charge for EV owners. However, more public chargers are needed to support mass adoption of EVs among segments of the population without access to home chargers. In 2024, more than 1.3 million public charging points were added to the global stock, representing an increase of more than 30% compared to the previous year. Just the charging points added in 2024 were approximately equal to the total number of points available in 2020. About two-thirds of the growth in public chargers since 2020 has occurred in China, which now has about 65% of the charging and 60% of the electric light-duty vehicle stock globally. In Europe, the number of public charging points grew more than 35% in 2024 compared to 2023, to reach just over 1 million. However, there are significant variations across countries due to differing rates of EV adoption and charging infrastructure development. Within the European Union, 11 out of 27 countries saw their public stock of charging points increase by more than 50% in 2024 compared to the previous year. At the end of 2024, the Netherlands had the largest national charging network in Europe, with over 180 000 public charging points, followed by Germany (160 000) and France (155 000). In Austria, 8 000 public charging points were added in 2024, most of which were supported by a subsidy that ended at the beginning of 2025. Installation of public charging points across the European Union is expected to increase as a result of the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR), which mandates the installation of fast-charging stations for cars and vans of at least 150 kW every 60 km along the TEN-T core road network by 2025. Each station must offer a minimum total power output of 400 kW, increasing to 600 kW by the end of 2027. In addition, roll-out of private charging at residential and commercial buildings is covered under the revised EU Energy Performance in Buildings Directive, which establishes criteria for pre-cabling to prevent the future need to retrofit parking infrastructure, which can be costly. Global EV Outlook 2025 Electric vehicle charging PAGE | 100 IEA. CC BY 4.0. The United States increased its charging stock by 20% in 2024 to just under 200 000 public charging points. The National EV Infrastructure Program, part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that was passed in 2021, allocated USD 5 billion to fund fast chargers along corridors, although by the end of 2024 only around USD 30 million had been spent on charging points that are now in operation. In January 2025, Executive Order 14154 paused the disbursement of these funds for a review of the processes, policies and programmes associated with grant selections, making future disbursements of the remaining unspent funds uncertain. Policy efforts in India continue to support charging accessibility, with about 40 000 new public chargers installed in 2024. In October 2024, INR 20 billion (USD 240 million) was allocated to charging infrastructure through the PM EDRIVE scheme, with a focus on urban centres and heavily-used transport corridors. However, the Indian government has also introduced an EV policy that caps the investment in charging infrastructure eligible for tariff relief, potentially impacting automakers' plans to invest in EV charging networks.

Variation in ratio of EVs per public charger reflects differences in market maturity and population demographics One way to think about public charging coverage is in terms of the number of public charging points compared to the stock of electric light-duty vehicles those points are meant to serve. China and the European Union have maintained a steady pace of charger deployment compared to the number of EVs on the road, though at different levels. There is now more than 1 public charger for every 10 electric cars in China. On average, the European Union has 1 charger for every 13 electric cars – a decrease of more than 10% compared to 2023.

In China’s densely populated cities, many drivers rely on public charging points, whereas in Europe, access to home chargers is far higher. The combined stock of the top 15 cities by public charger stock in China covers more than 50% of the national stock, compared to a share of 25% in Europe.

CC BY 4.0. important role in shaping the need for public charging access. For example, Germany and the United Kingdom both have a similar electric car stock share, but the United Kingdom has 60% more electric cars per public charger. In Germany, more than 60% of people live in apartments or flats; whereas in England and Wales, fewer than 25% of people do, meaning it may be easier to install private charging. In the early stages of electrification, greater availability of public EV charging points can encourage adoption. However, as EV adoption increases, and as charging speeds become faster and battery ranges improve, the number of charger points per vehicle can decrease as the system is optimised. Fast charging continues to expand, with ultra-fast charging having more than doubled in Europe since 2022 In addition to coverage, the capacity of public chargers can serve as an indication of sufficiency. Fast and ultra-fast public charging points can deliver more energy per day than slow chargers and thus serve a higher number of vehicles. In 2024, the global stock of fast chargers (with a power output higher than 22 kW and lower than 150 kW) reached 2 million, and ultra-fast chargers – capable of delivering 150 kW or above – growing by over 50% in 2024 and now accounting for nearly 10% of all fast chargers. Falling costs have played a role in this shift, with the price of ultra-fast chargers falling by 20% between 2022 and 2024. China remained the largest player in fast charging deployment last year, responsible for 80% of the global growth, with the number of fast chargers surging from 1.2 million in 2023 to 1.6 million in 2024.

At the end of 2024, there was less than 1.5 kW of public charging capacity available in the United States per electric LDV. Meanwhile, the European Union expanded its network of fast chargers (excluding ultra-fast) nearly 50% from 2023 to reach 71 000 in 2024, and has an average public charging capacity of 2.6 kW per electric LDV. It also saw strong deployment of ultra-fast charging points in 2024, increasing by 60% compared to 2023 to reach over 77 000 chargers. Denmark saw its stock of ultra-fast chargers more than double in 2024, and in France, Finland and Germany the stock increased by between 70-95%. Further expansions are also being planned, for example in France, where \"Charge France\", a charge point operator association established in 2025, committed to investing EUR 4 billion to expand the national stock of ultra-fast charging points from over 17 000 today to 40 000 by 2028.

Today, only a few high-end electric cars are capable of charging at this speed, but charging point operators such as FastNed and Iberdrola and BP Pulse are deploying these stations in anticipation of future demand.

Advances in battery technology for electric cars can make charging competitive with refuelling time, if charging infrastructure can keep up EV owners report that charging speed is their most important consideration when using public chargers. Safety concerns relating to EV battery technology have long been a limiting factor in reaching faster charging, but recent innovations are now reshaping the fast-charging landscape. During charging, lithium ions are released from the cathode to the anode. If the process is too slow compared to the desired charging speed, lithium can accumulate on the anode surface, forming dendrites – needle-like structures that can pierce the battery, potentially causing short circuits and uncontrolled fires. Recently, however, some battery manufacturers have largely succeeded in addressing this through advanced anode designs, such as multi-gradient layered structures, which accelerate lithium uptake. In 2023, CATL launched the Shenxing battery, which is able to charge about 30% of the battery in just 5 minutes, providing 200 km of additional range. This was further improved in 2024, when they released a battery offering similar energy density but faster charging speeds in collaboration with SAIC-GM – allowing to recharge over 40% of the battery capacity in 5 minutes – as well as a battery with the same charging speed (30% in 5 minutes) but increased energy density, providing 300 km of additional range in 5 minutes. For comparison, a typical Tesla supercharger can offer about 100 km of additional range during the same time. In March 2025, BYD set a new benchmark with its Super-e platform, which is claimed to deliver around 400 km of range in 5 minutes. This leap was made possible by nextgeneration silicon carbide power chips, all-liquid-cooling, and a 1 000 V architecture, which allows for coupling with 1 MW charging. Just one month later, CATL announced the second generation of its Shenxing battery, offering even higher charging speeds. Megawatt charging was previously limited to heavy-duty vehicles, where the energy was distributed across battery packs roughly ten times larger than those in passenger cars. Now, advances in battery technology and charging platforms are bringing this capability to the passenger car market, with the first models already on sale in China.

Maximum share of battery capacity charged and electric range added in 5 minutes by electric car model or battery technology IEA. CC BY 4.0. Notes: SoC = state of charge. Battery SoC added indicates how much the battery is recharged starting from a low SoC (20%). For example, adding 30% SoC means charging the battery from 20% to 50%. The additional range is calculated by multiplying the manufacturer’s stated electric range by the proportion of the battery that can be recharged in 5 minutes under optimal conditions. Tesla model Y and S are assumed to be charged through a third generation supercharger. Sources: IEA analysis based on data from EV Volumes, Tesla, Porsche, Hyundai, Lucid, CATL, GM authority, and BYD. The full realisation of these advantages, however, hinges on deploying ultra-highpower charging infrastructure. Megawatt chargers impose significant loads on grids, often requiring upgrades that could significantly slow down or limit deployment, and are more expensive than fast chargers, which could result in higher charging prices for consumers. Pairing these chargers with battery storage to alleviate peak demand and optimise grid usage might offer a pathway to accelerate their roll-out. In recognition of the infrastructural challenge, BYD – together with its Super-e platform – has announced plans to deploy 4 000 megawatt chargers supported by battery storage in China. This evolution would also strengthen the interdependencies between the two biggest battery markets – EV batteries and battery storage – potentially increasing the competitive advantage of producers manufacturing both, such as BYD and CATL. For most consumers, reliable fast charger networks capable of recharging a vehicle in 15-20 minutes may be sufficient for long-distance travel. However, the ability to charge EVs in a timeframe comparable to refuelling conventional cars could further accelerate consumer adoption. 120 360 600 0% 15% 30%"}

CC BY 4.0. Ultra-fast charging (150 kW and above) allows the most direct comparison with a conventional highway pit stop, where charging times of 15 minutes can provide an additional 150 km of driving range.1 For long trips on interstate or international corridors, EV drivers may prefer a longer break, meaning fast charging at rates between 22 kW and 150 kW may also be an attractive option. If fast chargers are also taken into account, the charging coverage in the European Union increases, with an additional 25% of the roads having a fast charger at least every 50 km. In the United States, the share of the interstate road network covered by a charging station also increases from nearly 30%, when considering ultra-fast charging exclusively, to nearly 40% when also including fast charging. Despite the high charging infrastructure coverage along European roads, the number of fast-charging stations along highways remains significantly lower than that of petrol stations. Ensuring a denser charging network would help to address range anxiety and help instil confidence in EV adoption by making charging as convenient and reassuring as conventional refuelling. This would allow for more flexibility in planning routes around charging stops and help address worst-case scenarios, such as unexpected detours, traffic delays, or extreme weather conditions. Public charging does not always equal accessible charging About 20% of public chargers in Europe are in fact “semi-public”, meaning that access is limited to part of the population, such as chargers provided by hotels or supermarkets that are only accessible to customers. Such chargers may also have physical barriers and more limited hours, which degrades charging access and experience. Technical barriers can also hinder ease of use, even for fully public charging stations, as can occur with incompatible plug types (e.g. Type 2, Combined Charging System, CHAdeMO). Other factors, such as the payment system or (in the case of Tesla chargers), the brand of the vehicle, can also limit the usability of charging infrastructure, reducing overall accessibility. Standardisation, in combination with access to reliable data on the availability and pricing of charging stations, will therefore be important for making public charging infrastructure more accessible. 1 This estimate assumes a fuel economy of 20 kWh/100 km and a minimum charging level of 20%.

Light-duty vehicle charging outlook Public charging capacity for light-duty EVs grows almost ninefold to 2030 In general, early adopters of electric cars have tended to have higher rates of access to home charging than the broader population. Even though electric LDVs represent 15% of the global stock in 2030 in the STEPS – which could be considered as moving past the early-adopter phase – home charging is expected to remain the preferred way to charge an EV when available, given the affordability and convenience. Charging availability at other private locations, such as at workplaces, and public charging, will also support more widespread adoption of EVs, especially among populations without access to home charging, or for travelling long distances. In the STEPS, around 150 million charging points are added from 2025 to the end of 2030, with almost two-thirds of those being home chargers, 30% other private chargers, and the remaining 8% public charging points. The build-out of public charging points in the STEPS is intended to reflect the number required to serve the stock of electric LDVs projected in the scenario. As such, the charging projections are based on the policies and market trends driving the vehicle projections as opposed to simply matching charging-related policies and regulations. The charging point projections do, however, account for regional trends, such as the historical evolution of the number of charging points per EV, the share and capacity of public fast chargers, and access to home and other private charging. Generally, as EV markets mature, optimisation of the public charging network is expected to improve, meaning that utilisation can increase with no negative effect on user experience. In line with this, in the STEPS, the number of electric LDVs per public charging point worldwide increases from about 11 in 2024 to around 14 in 2030. The number of charging points available constitutes just one metric of coverage; the installed charging capacity is also important. Public fast chargers, with their higher charging capacity, are able to provide more energy and thus serve more EVs per day than slow chargers. Over half of the charging capacity installed to serve electric LDVs between 2025 and the end of 2030 in the STEPS takes the form of fast public chargers. That means that the public fast charging capacity increases more than tenfold by 2030, while private charging capacity increases less than fourfold.

Home charging stock in 2024 is estimated based on electric light-duty vehicle stock and regional assumptions regarding the ratio of home chargers to vehicles. Regional projected electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) stock data can be explored via the interactive Global EV Data Explorer. In China, the relatively low ratio of electric LDVs to public charging points that has been maintained over the past decade is partly because Chinese EV owners have tended to be concentrated in dense cities with limited access to home charging. In the STEPS, the ratio of electric LDVs per public charging point remains relatively low but still grows to around 11. The stock of public charging points in China grows more than threefold by 2030 in the STEPS, reaching over 12 million charging points. The share of public fast chargers continues to grow, as it has during the first half of this decade, increasing from around 45% in 2024 to over 50% in 2030. In 2024, China added about 850 000 public charging points. The average annual additions needed to reach the public charging stock projected in the STEPS in 2030 are about 75% higher than was observed in 2024, and 60% higher than the additions in 2023.

Regional charging point projections can be explored via the interactive Global EV Data Explorer. In Europe, the stock of public charging points doubles by 2030 in the STEPS to reach more than 2 million. The share of fast chargers continues to increase and reaches 30% in 2030 in the STEPS, up from less than 20% in 2024. As such, public charging capacity across Europe reaches 115 GW in 2030, including slow and fast chargers. The increase in the share of fast chargers, as well as the growth in their average power rating, means that while the ratio of electric LDVs per charging point increases from less than 15 in 2024 to close to 25 in 2030, the public charging capacity per vehicle increases to over 2 kW per electric LDV. This level of public charging capacity exceeds the power output targets laid out in the EU AFIR (1.3 kW per battery electric LDV and 0.8 kW per plug-in hybrid). To reach the level of public charging projected in the STEPS in 2030, Europe must add 210 000 public charging points per year on average through 2030, which is less than the 275 000 public charging points added across Europe in 2024. Beyond EU regulation, there are national targets for public charging infrastructure in Europe. For example, the French government aims to have 400 000 publicly accessible charging stations by 2030, about two-and-a-half times the number available at the end of 2024. The UK government has stated an aim for at least 300 000 public charging stations in 2030, about three-and-a-half times the stock in 2024. The German government has also previously set a target of 1 million public charging points by 2030, though energy industry groups have criticised this target for being more than will be needed. 6 18 30 42 2 6 10 14 2030 2030 2030 2030 China Europe United States Rest of World Electric LDVs per public charging point Million public charging points Slow Fast EVs per public charging point (right axis) Global EV Outlook 2025 Electric vehicle charging PAGE | 115 IEA.

In India, the number of public charging points increases from 75 000 at the end of 2024 to around 375 000 by the end of 2030 in the STEPS to support a stock of less than 3 million electric LDVs. As a result, in 2030 in the STEPS there are around 7 electric LDVs per public charging point, up from fewer than 4 in 2024. To reach this projected stock of public charging points, around 50 000 charging points would need to be added on average each year through 2030, about 30% more than the number of additions observed in 2024. India’s PM E-DRIVE Scheme includes INR 20 billion (Indian rupees) (USD 240 million) for public EV charging stations, with plans to support a targeted 22 100 EV chargers for electric fourwheeled vehicles through March 2026. Across other countries, about 630 000 public charging points are added between the end of 2024 and 2030 in the STEPS, or an average of 105 000 new public charging points per year. Governments around the world have set targets for public charging points to support expansion to 2030 and beyond. Japan targets a stock of 300 000 public charging points by 2030, about 9 times the stock at the end of 2024. The government of New Zealand aims to have 10 000 charge points by 2030, a seven-fold increase from the end of 2024. Across Southeast Asia, Indonesia aims to reach 30 000 charging stations by 2030 and Thailand 12 000. Charging electric heavy-duty vehicles Megawatt-scale chargers are now being deployed In general, electric heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) can use the same charging equipment as LDVs, although different charging station configurations may be needed to accommodate the HDVs, given their larger size. In addition, as the batteries of HDVs are larger and therefore take longer to replenish, higherpowered chargers are needed to minimise disruptions to regular operations. The effective deployment of electric HDVs is therefore likely to require the buildout of devoted charging equipment to ensure charging times compatible with the operational efficiency of commercial fleets. Most electric HDV operators today rely on depot charging when the vehicles are not in use, typically overnight, but en route or opportunity chargers are generally also needed to enable longer-range applications. The growth in deployment of electric buses has been enabled by the buildout of charging depots by national and local governments as well as by transit agencies. For example, in the United Kingdom, the government’s Zero Emission Bus Regional Areas scheme supported the establishment of an electric bus charging hub to power South Yorkshire’s first electric buses. Germany’s Deutsche Bahn and various partners have supported charging infrastructure for electric buses that charge exclusively at the depot overnight. In China, policy support for bus charging Global EV Outlook 2025 Electric vehicle charging PAGE | 117 IEA.

As with buses, the roll-out of depot chargers is expected to lead the first phase of electric truck charging deployment, as fleet operators have the greatest control over private charging infrastructure. However, scaling up public chargers of 350 kW or more will be critical to support wider adoption. The EU Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation sets specific targets for HDV charging, including charging points with an individual power output of at least 350 kW every 60 km along primary roads and every 100 km along secondary roads. Megawatt chargers are also expected to play a role in HDV charging, given that reducing charging time is highly valued in the sector. An HDV with a battery pack of 300 kWh (similar to the global sales-weighted average in 2024) would require about 30 minutes to recharge2 using a 350 kW charger, but only about 15 minutes using a megawatt charger. In 2024, the world’s first megawatt chargers for trucks were deployed in the United States and Europe, marking a key technological milestone. Enabling such higher-powered charging requires timely planning, permitting and investment to upgrade power grids. Both depot and public charging frequently require grid reinforcements to enable ultra-fast charging, sometimes in remote locations. Even if overnight charging in depots or service stations is relatively slow, the grid connection must be able to handle the parallel charging of multiple vehicles. Coupling megawatt chargers with battery storage can alleviate grid stress, reducing the need for power grid upgrades and accelerating megawatt charger deployments. This approach could be important for speeding up the roll-out of electric trucks, and has also been announced for ultra-fast charging of cars (see the Box above). National statistics on HDV-specific chargers are not readily available for most countries. However, there is evidence that in China, one company alone had built about 1 350 charging stations with over 5 500 charging points for electric trucks by the end of October 2024, each with a charging capacity of more than 320 kW. Based on data compiled by Atlas EV Hub, the United States reported around 500 operational HDV charging points in October 2024 – about double the number at the beginning of 2024 – and over 1 000 more are planned. Less than one-third of the existing chargers are accessible to the public, but around 85% of all planned chargers, including at high-power charging stations, are expected to be publicly accessible. 2 Between 20% and 80% of the battery state of charge.

In India, the PM E-DRIVE scheme proposes installing 1 800 fast chargers for e-buses in larger cities and on selected highways. Elsewhere, Qatar’s Public Bus Infrastructure Program has built over 650 charging points for electric buses to support the country’s goal of reaching 100% public bus electrification by 2030. In Latin America, countries are collaborating to build EV recharging corridors, including for buses and trucks, and the first truck charging station in Peru was opened at the Port of Callao in 2024. In Singapore, Volt has been awarded a contract to develop and operate an 80-point direct-current charging hub for electric taxis, buses and other EVs. Meanwhile, Malaysian governmentowned Prasarana has issued tenders for electric bus procurement and charging infrastructure deployment. Industry players are teaming up to deploy charging for heavy trucks HDV charging infrastructure is still in its early stages and requires significant investments, but it is gaining momentum. Private companies are joining forces to expand charging networks.

CC BY 4.0. corridors announced at COP29. These corridors aim to deploy sufficient charging infrastructures along key routes connecting industrial hubs, ports and cities, and focus on creating replicable models for infrastructure deployment and financing, aiming to accelerate global deployment. The Kuehne Climate Center and Smart Freight Centre have also initiated the Green Freight Support Program in Eastern Africa. Heavy-duty vehicle charging outlook Charging capacity for trucks and buses increases more than fivefold by 2030 Just as for charging LDVs, overnight charging tends to be the most attractive option for buses and trucks, as it requires lower power and is typically cheaper. This is especially the case among early adopters. While public or opportunity charging infrastructure for electric HDVs is limited, electric fleet owners and/or operators typically choose to install depot chargers at close to a one-to-one ratio to allow the fleet to charge concurrently during the night. Of course, to enable longer daily driving ranges, en route or other opportunity chargers (such as at terminal bus stops or highway service stations) are needed to expand the applications that can be met by electric HDVs.

CC BY 4.0. points remain located at depots through this decade in this scenario. The stock of chargers for trucks grows more quickly than for buses, increasing from a third of all HDV chargers to almost 60% in 2030 in the STEPS. The charging capacity for electric HDVs grows similarly to the stock – increasing about five times to 2030 in the STEPS to reach more than 500 GW. Given that the role for higher-power opportunity chargers is expected to remain limited this decade, the overall charging capacity for HDVs remains around 100 kW per electric HDV. Despite the relatively low power rating for depot chargers – typically 50-150 kW compared to 350 kW to 1 MW+ for some opportunity charging – grid upgrades at depots may be needed, especially for larger fleets. Grid upgrades can take from one to several years, depending (in particular) on the voltage. Anticipatory planning is needed to ensure adequate availability of HDV chargers in the medium- to long-term.

Smart charging and vehicle-grid integration Smart charging gains popularity, bolstered by smart charging roll-out mandates Electric vehicles represent less than 1% of global electricity demand today, but their contribution to power demand is affected by charging behaviour. Depending on local grid conditions, EV charging can put stress on electricity grids. Extra demand from unmanaged EV charging during peak times can mean grids need to enlist more carbon-intensive power plants and may increase electricity prices for households using electricity at these times. As a result, governments, utilities and private companies have started to develop and deploy technologies to enable Global EV Outlook 2025 Electric vehicle charging PAGE | 121 IEA. CC BY 4.0. smart charging. Smart chargers can be connected to the internet and accessed remotely, allowing for controlled scheduling. When used in conjunction with differentiated tariffs, smart chargers enable EV owners to charge flexibly and take advantage of the cheapest tariffs under different pricing regimes (e.g. time-of-use, dynamic real-time, critical peak pricing, etc.), while providing demand-side flexibility for grid operators. Smart charging can also support EV battery health, such as by adjusting the maximum charging rate to avoid overcharging and excessive heat, which can degrade batteries over time. Smart charging is advancing towards wider commercial deployment. The United Kingdom was among the first countries to mandate that all new home charge points for EVs must have smart functionality from 2022. Prior to this, only 52% of UK EV owners with home charging capabilities had a smart charger. The EU AFIR specifies that all chargers that are installed or renovated from April 2024 must support smart charging. China has longstanding policies on smart charging roll-out from previous Five-Year Plans on Electric Vehicle Deployment, with newer chargers now having smart charging capabilities. Elsewhere, Brazil is taking strides in expanding EV infrastructure through its “electrocenters” – charging hubs designed to optimise power distribution to ensure grid resilience while accommodating multiple vehicles simultaneously, launched in March 2024. Multiple actors are involved in efforts to implement vehicle-to-grid solutions While smart charging enables EV owners to choose when to charge their EVs, bidirectional charging provides them with the opportunity to discharge power from their EVs to their homes (vehicle-to-home, or V2H), buildings (V2B), or other appliance loads (V2L) and the grid (V2G). Bi-directional charging can be used to recharge car batteries when electricity is cheapest, and then sell electricity back to the grid (V2G) when prices are higher. It can also be used to discharge car batteries to provide emergency or off-grid power supply to buildings or loads (V2B, V2H, V2L). For widespread application of V2G, multiple legal and technological hurdles need to be overcome so that demand-side flexibility from EVs can work effectively for the maximum benefit of EV owners and grid operators. Progress across markets is currently mixed due to the complexity of the requirements needed along the V2G pipeline. As a first step, smart chargers that can schedule charging and discharging from the grid must be deployed across the EV charging network. Secondly, EVs must be capable of bi-directional charging. Today there are over 30 bi-directionalcapable models available, an increase of nearly 20% from 2023. Bi-directional models now make up more than one in eight new electric cars sold, with models Global EV Outlook 2025 Electric vehicle charging PAGE | 122 IEA.

Aggregators and ancillary service markets act as middle management between grid distribution operators, to provide bids and pool flexible EVs and other storage devices so that grid operators can then purchase this flexibility. To facilitate the transmission of electricity between these market aggregators, sufficient management of EV batteries connecting to the grid must also be supported by adequate grid infrastructure so as to avoid grid congestion and enable bi-directional charging. Demonstration trials of V2G projects are currently underway in markets including Australia, China, Germany, Korea and the United Kingdom, where the government is funding 20 V2G projects involving around 600 cars. A demonstration project launched in November 2024 in the Netherlands represents one of the largest V2G car-sharing services in Europe to date, using 500 Renault 5 E-Tech BEVs. In 2023, the Korea Electric Power Corporation was involved in a 100-vehicle V2G pilot programme. It found that EVs effectively contributed to peak shaving, and that battery degradation was minimal, but further refinement of financial incentives would be needed to make the V2G system financially attractive to a wide consumer base. In August 2024, China’s National Development and Reform Commission issued a notice promoting the piloting of large-scale applications of V2G interactions, and selected 5 cities to kick off at least 50 V2G pilot projects. The notice also established grid communication standards for EV charging equipment that enables V2G bi-directional charging. A national road map for bi-directional charging has been developed by Australia, which suggests that adopting V2G in just 10% of Australia’s projected EVs could help meet more than one-third of the national electricity market’s storage needs in 2030. As of February 2025, a small number of Australian households have adopted V2G technology and are selling power back to the grid. In the United States, in March 2025, ComEd, an energy provider in northern Illinois, partnered with Nuvve to launch a V2G pilot programme focusing on electric school buses. Policy measures targeting bi-directional charging are increasingly being introduced in different markets worldwide. In the European Union, updated AFIR requirements will include standards that enable bi-directional charging, starting in 2027. In the United States, the Federal Highway Administration previously mandated via the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (2021) that chargers must conform to and possess hardware capable of implementing both smart Global EV Outlook 2025 Electric vehicle charging PAGE | 123 IEA. CC BY 4.0. charging and bi-directional charging for compatible vehicles (ISO 15118-20). At the state level, California enacted legislation to promote V2G adoption in September 2024. Ensuring compatibility and interoperability of the chargers and EVs involved are the final challenges. The CHAdeMO EV charging system first introduced V2G communication in 2010 and has been the first mover in this domain. Since then, the charging protocols adopted by the CHAdeMo Association have continued to evolve as technology has developed. Several organisations have also been working to define appropriate standards and use cases. Efforts to standardise protocols and grid codes are ongoing through the Electric Vehicle Technology Collaboration Programme Task 53: Interoperability of Bidirectional Charging. In addition, the International Electrotechnical Commission has published use cases on how EVs might provide distributed energy resource functionality.

Global EV Outlook 2025 Electric vehicle charging PAGE | 125 Shaping human behaviour around charging will be key to unlocking the full benefits of electric vehicles Patterns of human behaviour will have a big impact on how EVs affect the grid. Different charging habits will affect the costs of charging, grid congestion and reliability, but with the right incentives to align charging behaviour with the needs of the grid, EVs could become a major source of flexibility and demand response. Charging behaviour also affects emissions. Many electric grids – such as those in California, Germany, and Spain – have deployed large amounts of solar power, which peaks around midday. If EV charging uses this solar power, while avoiding peak load periods such as early evening when people return home after work, EVs could help stabilise the grid while also maximising emissions reductions. In California, electric cars charged overnight emit 76% less CO2 than conventional ICE vehicles – but EVs charged around midday go much further, slashing emissions 95% relative to ICEs. Annual well-to-wheel emissions from gasoline and electric cars in California, 2024 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Source: Emissions estimated by UC San Diego based on data from the California Air Resources Board. Social science research is now looking at how to influence behaviour in ways that help EVs become a reliable resource for the grid and cut emissions. Researchers from the University of California San Diego (UC San Diego), working with the Electric Power Research Institute and others, are using randomised controlled trials at UC San Diego’s network of over 500 charging points. Experiments that derived from 1 200 drivers are assessing whether interventions change habits in the real world. In one study, they told drivers how midday charging reduces emissions and found that drivers responded by reducing their campus charging at times other than midday by 5%. While modest, this effect is similar in scale to other kinds of informational “nudges” studied with other behaviours that affect the grid, such as household energy choices. A key issue the research team explored is that many EV drivers have little prior knowledge about charging costs and emissions impacts. Information helps fill that void. A second project offered discounts for campus charging to test drivers’ willingness to relocate their charging. In a twist, incentives to charge on campus actually led drivers to Gasoline ICEV (baseline): 5.1 t CO2 BEV charged overnight: 1.2 t CO2 (-76%) BEV charged midday: 0.3 t CO2 (-95%) Global EV Outlook 2025 Electric vehicle charging PAGE | 126 charge more (7%) in the early morning and overnight, rather than during the midday solar peak. The findings suggest that scarcity of chargers was the reason for this unexpected behaviour – drivers expected that the discounts would increase competition for scarce chargers and tended to hoard access as a result. Some recent preliminary findings suggest that network quality also affects charging behaviour. When drivers have poor charging experiences, they are reluctant to return. This points to the increasing need to focus on the quality of charging networks, not just the quantity of charge points. Some policy makers have begun this shift, such as in Germany. As the number of EVs on the road increases, choices about charging will have bigger impacts on the grid. That raises the stakes for learning how to get people to charge in more optimal ways, which will often mean at offices and other locations away from home at differing times of the day. Using real-world charging data to test business models will be vital for sustainably building the networks to support such charging.

Using real-world charging data to test business models will be vital for sustainably building the networks to support such charging. Transport flexibility through methods such as smart and managed charging has relevance around the world. For example, in a case where EVs represent 80% of the vehicle stock in Europe, and over 40% of final energy demand is met by electricity, around a quarter of this electricity demand has some flexibility potential. Over a third of this flexibility potential comes from EVs, where optimised smart charging and changes in charging behaviour can shift peak demand away from the congestion and higher emissions that occur during evening hours to the middle of the day when the availability of renewables, especially solar, to supply the grid would be higher than the electricity demand without the additional charging load.

Battery swapping systems, for example, have been around in some form for over a century, though use has been somewhat limited, but deployment is now rapidly growing in certain regions and segments. Battery swapping is proving especially successful in commercial applications such as delivery or ridehailing services, where downtime for charging can be costly. Battery swapping can offer benefits by reducing the upfront cost of EVs; improving battery longevity, especially with professional handling of swaps; alleviating stress on power grids; and facilitating reuse and recycling efforts when batteries remain under the ownership of the swap company. However, these systems may increase overall demand for batteries and would benefit from design standardisation that could be difficult to achieve at large scales in some markets. Standardising batteries could also inhibit innovation, such as the development of cell-to-chassis architectures that can improve EV efficiency by reducing the weight of battery systems. The benefits of standardisation for battery swapping must be weighed against the risk of constraining market competition and innovation. Dynamic charging – which takes place while vehicles are moving – is also being explored. This can be accomplished through conductive charging, such as using overhead catenary lines, which are already commonly used to power transport systems like trams and light rail systems, or through inductive, wireless charging, which is at an earlier stage of development and deployment. Both systems can be deployed at strategic locations for stationary charging, such as at bus stops or logistics centres where vehicles already spend time idle. These systems and other innovations, such as solar-coupled charging systems, can play a role in making charging more convenient and/or a source of flexible demand for renewables, as well as reducing charging-related stress on grids. Battery swapping for 2/3Ws is increasingly popular in emerging markets Battery swapping systems for 2/3Ws offer a number of benefits, including improving affordability, which can be particularly helpful for consumers in developing economies, where upfront costs can be a barrier. The “battery-as-aservice” subscription model can lower the upfront investment required for an electric 2W, as the battery typically accounts for around 40% of the total price. In terms of operational costs, for the amount of range provided, battery-swapenabled 2/3Ws are around 20-50% cheaper than petrol 2/3Ws, and the economic case improves as daily driving distance increases. Battery swapping can also offer Global EV Outlook 2025 Electric vehicle charging PAGE | 128 time savings. While at least 20 minutes (and typically several hours) is required for recharging an electric 2W, battery swapping can be performed in just 2-5 minutes – approximately the same amount of time needed to refuel a gasoline motorcycle. It can eliminate the need for home charging, making electric 2/3Ws more accessible to drivers with limited electricity access. In addition, in countries with underdeveloped power grids, the more centralised load/demand management offered by some battery swap stations can be beneficial. Thailand, for example, is targeting 1 450 battery swapping stations by 2030. In Indonesia, the start-up SWAP Energi"}

Thailand, for example, is targeting 1 450 battery swapping stations by 2030. In Indonesia, the start-up SWAP Energi currently operates around 1 500 electric 2W battery swap stations in the country. The Indonesian government has set the target of about 67 000 battery swap stations, for either motorcycles or cars, by 2030. Battery swapping has also taken off in India in the past 5 years, thanks to technological improvements for batteries and falling costs coinciding with a rise in gasoline prices. Electric 2/3Ws – sold without the battery – have now become accessible even to low-income buyers. Battery Smart is India’s largest battery swap operator for 2/3Ws and reached 1 000 stations in April 2024. Indian company Sun Mobility is also growing fast, with more than 630 swapping stations in 19 Indian cities. There are also plans to deploy 10 000 Piaggio electric 3Ws with swappable batteries in the country, alongside 300 new swapping stations. In Chinese Taipei, the market for electric 2/3Ws has grown significantly due to strong demand and government support, accompanied by an innovative, widespread battery swapping mechanism that has become a global leader. Domestic battery swapping pioneer Gogoro now has around 13 000 battery swap stations worldwide, each roughly the size of 2 vending machines and able to hold around 30 scooter batteries. In the city of Taipei, there are now more Gogoro battery swapping stations for 2Ws than gas stations. A total 2 500 Gogoro stations use artificial intelligence (AI) and can act as a virtual power plant – drawing power from the grid when usage is low, and returning it when usage is high, and even supplying back-up power in emergencies. After the country was hit by an earthquake in April 2024, battery swap stations made 6 MW of power available, enough to power thousands of homes. However, Gogoro has struggled to find a sustainable business model and benefits from government purchase subsidies. In Africa, Spiro, an electric motorbike manufacturer and battery swapping provider, has put over 22 000 e-bikes on the road across a number of different countries. Kenyan company Arc Ride runs a battery-as-a-service model for 2W battery swapping, with over 140 stations, mostly around Nairobi. Kenya is also a target for Rwandan Ampersand’s expansion plans, and Roam is setting up solarpowered fast battery charging and swapping for electric motor cycles in the country. Global EV Outlook 2025 Electric vehicle charging PAGE | 129 Battery swapping systems for 2/3Ws are still in their infancy in Europe, a far smaller market for 2/3Ws, although the supermarket chain Kaufland is operating swapping stations for batteries for small electric cars or electric 2Ws in Romania in co-operation with the e-Mobility Rentals start-up. Honda is also launching battery swap stations in Sweden for their electric scooters. Greater standardisation and interoperability would be needed to fully reap the benefits of battery swapping and reduce the need for costly charging infrastructure. This would also enable the aggregation of demand for electric 2/3W batteries and help to guide industry development. In 2022, various Japanese OEMs established a new company, Gachaco, to offer a battery sharing and swapping services for standardised, exchangeable 2W batteries. More recently, in 2024, Thailand launched the Thailand Standard Swappable Battery Consortium for Small e-Mobility to work towards elevating the national standard to the level of international standards. Battery swapping for cars is growing in China and entering new markets Chinese EV manufacturer NIO built its first battery swap station for electric cars in 2018 and has remained the market leader ever since. By the end of 2024, NIO had built over 3 000 battery swap stations in China and 50 in Europe. In just 2 years, the company more than doubled its battery swap stations in China. In an effort to co-ordinate battery standards and battery swapping technologies, and maximise the utilisation of NIO’s network, the company has agreements with Geely Group, JAC Group and Chery Automobile, which together represented 15% of electric car sales in China in 2024. Battery maker CATL introduced its battery swap solution, EVOGO, in 2022. The company has since announced the ambition to reach 3 000 stations by 2027, and eventually 10 000 stations.

The programme also aims to build 30 000 battery swap stations that will also work as battery-to-grid energy storage facilities. In 2024, Ample announced it was partnering with ENEOS to bring battery swap stations to Kyoto, in a first for Japan. Ample is also partnering with Stellantis, beginning with a programme to provide battery swap stations in Madrid for Fiat 500e cars in the Free2Move car-sharing service. Global EV Outlook 2025 Electric vehicle charging PAGE | 130 For trucks, battery swapping can offer savings in terms of reducing charging time As of June 2023, there were around 400 battery swap stations for trucks in China. While battery swapping for heavy-duty trucks is still at an early stage of deployment, it has the potential to support faster uptake of electric trucks by extending battery lifespan and reducing the wait time for charging, thus enhancing efficiency for commercial operations. For example, even electric truck batteries large enough to enable daily mileage suitable for long-distance transportation can be exchanged in around 10 minutes – almost as fast as refuelling a diesel truck. Battery swapping for trucks can offer greater benefit in terms of preserving battery health compared to other EV segments; the constant use and long distances travelled by trucks result in increased battery degradation, which is compounded by reliance on fast-charging solutions that further accelerate degradation. Battery swapping is particularly well-suited to fleets of identical trucks with heavy operational demands, operating on well-defined routes. These fleets could justify the significant investment required in automated swapping facilities and additional batteries. As such, battery swapping has been deployed for trucks used in shorthaul applications at ports, mining sites, urban and even regional logistics, particularly in China where sales of swap-capable electric trucks reached almost 30 000 last year. Elsewhere, Rio Tinto announced in 2024 they would trial eight electric dump trucks with battery swap technology for their mining operations in Mongolia. In Japan, field tests using courier services also began in 2024 for a Mitsubishi Fuso and Ample truck battery swap demonstration. Technological advances have enhanced the safety, reliability and convenience of battery swapping systems for trucks in recent years. Intelligent systems can now automatically assess battery status and perform the swapping service. In China, new policies were announced in 2024, enacting safety standards for swapcapable HDVs and establishing technical specification systems. However, in other parts of the world, the required level of standardisation may make it difficult for battery swapping to compete with conventional plug-in charging, especially for certain heavy-duty truck segments. In Europe, the region’s first fully automated heavy-duty electric truck battery swapping station opened in Germany in 2023. Swappable batteries are also being used as hybrid solutions for trucks, for example in German company Trailer Dynamics’ electric trailer with a swappable battery. Similarly, in the United States, Revoy has launched a battery swapping solution that can integrate with semitrucks, offering up to 235 miles of range, which can essentially turn a diesel truck into a hybrid vehicle, or serve as a range extender for an electric truck. While Global EV Outlook 2025 Electric vehicle charging PAGE | 131 battery swapping demonstrations and technology developments are ongoing, outside of China, manufacturers have been reluctant to separate battery ownership from vehicles, which would disrupt traditional revenue streams, and to standardise, which has been crucial to China's success. Electric road systems are being tested across major EV markets Electric road systems (ERS) enable vehicles to receive electricity while moving using one of three main technologies: conductive overhead (catenary) lines, conductive contact rails beneath the vehicles, and inductive wireless systems embedded in the road. Conductive contact rails and inductive systems can charge both light and heavy vehicles, while overhead lines are used for heavy vehicles. In all cases, vehicles must be equipped with appropriate pantographs or receivers.

Research has highlighted the benefits of wireless charging of buses to resolve space constraints at depots and to enable en route charging that can make battery electric buses more comparable to gasoline fuelled buses in terms of operations. Similar benefits exist for catenary charging solutions strategically located at bus stops. However, ERS infrastructure is expensive to install – depending on the type of system, the cost per kilometre could range from EUR 1.5 million for overhead catenary to over EUR 3 million for inductive charging. Test projects for electric road technology are ongoing worldwide, exploring both inductive and conductive methods. Sweden has been a global pioneer, while projects are also being undertaken in the United States, China and Japan.

Electric vehicle batteries Trends in battery demand Global battery demand for the energy sector hit the 1 TWh milestone in 2024 Electric cars remain the main driver of battery demand, but demand for trucks nearly doubled Battery demand in the energy sector, for both EV batteries and storage applications, reached the historical milestone of 1 TWh in 2024. Demand for one average week alone in 2024 exceeded the total demand for an entire year just a decade earlier. Demand was largely driven by growth in EV sales, as demand for EV batteries grew to over 950 GWh – 25% more than in 2023. Electric cars remain the principal factor behind EV battery demand, accounting for over 85%. Compared to 2023, the sector whose demand grew the most was electric trucks, growing over 75% in 2024 to reach nearly 3% of global EV battery demand. Electric truck battery demand was driven by growth in China, but demand also ramped up in Europe (about 25%), which accounted for about 10% of the global total.

Battery demand in the United States nearly matched that of the European Union in 2024, in part as a result of its approximately 25% larger battery size per EV. Emerging markets and developing economies other than China continued to represent only a small share of global battery demand, reaching nearly 5% in 2024. Nevertheless, their share has doubled since 2022, underpinned by sustained growth in Southeast Asia, India and Brazil. Average electric car battery pack size by region and powertrain, 2015-2024 IEA.

Electric vehicle and battery stockpiling are excluded from the analysis. Battery demand is also set to become more geographically diverse. In the STEPS, emerging markets and developing economies other than China are expected to double their share of EV battery demand, from nearly 5% in 2024 to 10% in 2030. The share of global demand in the European Union and other advanced economies, such as the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and Korea, is also projected to grow, while the share of the United States is projected to decline from about 13% in 2024 to less than 10% by 2030. Meanwhile, China’s share of global battery demand declines from 60% in 2024 to just under 50% by 2030, although it remains by far the single largest source of demand. Battery industry trends Chinese manufacturers are increasing their competitive advantage Low critical mineral prices and intense competition drove down battery prices in 2024, but China’s price advantage is widening Prices for lithium-ion battery packs fell 20% in 2024 – the largest drop since 2017 – as a result of low critical mineral prices and battery margins being squeezed through competition, predominantly in China.

Low critical mineral prices are primarily driven by supply surplus, which is making it difficult for some mining companies to compete, thus increasing the level of supply chain concentration among established players. This surplus is expected to persist over the next few years, but low prices could discourage future investments and might cause supply shortages for lithium and nickel by 2030. In addition, the high geographical and ownership concentration of their supply chains may cause market distortions, increasing market risk. An undersupply of lithium would push up prices, to the benefit of the mining sector but to the detriment of battery and EV makers, as well as final consumers. The recycling sector, which could help curb cost increases, would also benefit from higher mineral prices. However, due to feedstock limitations, it will take about a decade before recycling has a significant impact on reducing primary mineral demand (see the Box on battery recycling below). Technology innovation, particularly related to sodium-ion batteries or direct lithium extraction, could be instrumental in reducing the risk of lithium undersupply and its potential impact, and avoiding price spikes similar to those seen in 2022. Additionally, vertical integration through upstream investments can help battery suppliers to lower production costs while safeguarding against the risk of volatile critical mineral prices.

The faster pace of battery cost reduction and innovation in China has been enabled by fierce competition that has driven down profit margins for most producers (though not all), at the same time as driving up manufacturing efficiency and yields, as well as access to a large skilled workforce, and battery supply chain integration. Battery chemistry also plays an important role, with lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries – the main battery chemistry used in China – being almost 30% cheaper per kilowatt-hour (kWh) than lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide (NMC) batteries, which remain the most widely used batteries in the United States and Europe. NMC batteries still provide an energy density advantage, though the gap has narrowed in recent years. The energy density of LFP battery packs is about one-fifth lower by mass (Wh/kg) and about one-third lower by volume (Wh/L) than that of NMC packs. This is, however, partially offset by LFP’s ability to reach 100% state of charge when required without significant degradation, whereas NMC batteries are typically limited to 80% to preserve long-term performance. The higher energy density of NMC batteries remains an advantage for applications requiring longer ranges or operation in cold climates, where LFP technology is typically less effective. However, LFP batteries have now reached a performance level sufficient for most EV applications, making their lower cost a key advantage for automakers aiming to mass markets.

In 2024, battery pack prices per kWh for plug-in hybrid electric cars were more than three times those for battery electric cars, because of their smaller size and greater power requirements. In 2024, the average price of a 20 kWh PHEV battery pack – roughly the global sales-weighted average for standard plug-in hybrids – was about the same as a 65 kWh BEV battery pack, the global sales-weighted average for battery electric cars. Pack components such as the battery management system are common to BEV and PHEV battery packs, but given that PHEV packs are smaller, the price of such components is spread across fewer battery cells, increasing the price per kWh. PHEV battery packs may also require more complex designs to accommodate the internal combustion engine, which increases their production cost. Additionally, because of the smaller pack size, each battery cell in the PHEV pack has higher power requirements to guarantee minimum acceleration standards while driving in full electric mode. This demands different battery designs, such as thinner electrodes, to improve battery power at the expense of its energy density,1 further increasing the cost per kWh compared to BEVs. Smaller battery sizes also increase prices per kWh for 2/3W batteries. Battery specifics, however, only determine prices for high volume. For instance, in China, electric truck battery prices per kWh are slightly lower than for battery electric cars, thanks to their larger size and therefore the reduced contribution of the battery pack cost.

Lithium iron phosphate batteries continue to gain market share, and with them so do Chinese manufacturers In 2024, LFP batteries made up nearly half of the global EV battery market, underpinning the efforts of manufacturers to lower EV prices and production costs in order to maintain or gain market share in an increasingly competitive market. China leads on the uptake of LFP batteries, which met nearly three-quarters of its domestic battery demand in 2024, and their share shows no sign of slowing down, reaching 80% of batteries sold in November and December 2024. In the United States, the share of LFP batteries used in EVs slightly contracted in 2024, remaining below 10%, which may be a result of tariffs on Chinese batteries. In contrast, in the European Union, LFP battery adoption grew by about 90% for 1 “Energy density” is used here as a general term referring to the amount of energy stored per unit of mass or volume. It can be divided into two specific metrics: specific energy (Wh/kg) and energy density (Wh/L). Specific energy influences the additional weight the battery adds to the vehicle, thereby affecting its efficiency. Energy density determines the amount of energy that can be stored in a battery pack of a given size, typically defined by the vehicle's chassis dimensions and shape. Global EV Outlook 2025 Electric vehicle batteries PAGE | 140 the second consecutive year to reach more than 10% of the EU EV market. Notably, nearly all the LFP batteries for electric cars sold in Europe or the United States were produced in China, which today has a de facto monopoly on this type of battery. Market penetration of LFP batteries is moving even faster in other markets. In Southeast Asia, Brazil and India, the share of electric car batteries using LFP reached more than 50% in 2024. In Southeast Asia and Brazil, LFP uptake is led by imports from China, mostly by BYD, whereas in India it is driven by cars produced domestically, led by Tata Motors. In the United States, the vast majority (three-quarters) of EVs equipped with LFP batteries are produced domestically, whereas in the European Union nearly twothirds are imported from China. In both regions, LFP batteries are primarily sourced from China, with Tesla playing a central role – accounting for 85% of LFP battery-powered EVs produced in the United States and almost half of those sold in the European Union. Of Tesla’s LFP EVs sold in the European Union, over half are produced in Germany, with the remainder imported from China.

However, investments in LFP battery manufacturing in Europe might suffer as a result of the recent proposition from the Chinese government to limit exports of key battery technologies, including LFP cathode production and lithium processing. Overall, renewed interest in the LFP chemistry exacerbates the difficulties facing the European battery industry, which has historically focused on NMC batteries. The year 2024 was a challenging one for the European battery industry, with both small and large producers suffering for different reasons. New players such as Northvolt, which filed for bankruptcy in the United States and Sweden, faced serious difficulties in scaling up production, leading to insufficient manufacturing yield and high production costs. The case of Northvolt was further aggravated by limited experience, ambitious expansion plans, and excessively widened scope, leading to insufficient focus on scaling up high-quality battery cell production. Falling battery prices worldwide also weighed heavily on small producers, which have fewer resources and insufficient production volumes to withstand lower profit margins, and are now turning to a more cautious growth path. Korean companies, such as LG Energy Solution in Poland, are the largest battery producers in Europe, but their market share is also under pressure. Over the past 2 years, the market share of Korean manufacturers in the European Union has fallen from nearly 80% in 2022 to 60% in 2024, to the benefit of Chinese manufacturers. A key reason for this is the increased success of the LFP chemistry. In contrast, the share of Korean companies in the United States grew from about 20% in 2022 to over 35% in 2024, at the expense of Japanese manufacturers. Korean manufacturers are rising to the challenge and are now investing in LFP, including through innovation efforts, and are scaling up LFP battery production, including in Europe and the United States. LFP battery development is also advancing in Japan: In early 2025, Nissan announced plans to build an LFP battery plant after receiving government certification in late 2024. Yet Chinese manufacturers are continuing to innovate LFP chemistry and performance simultaneously, further raising the bar for other producers. At the same time, the Chinese government’s proposed export restrictions on advanced LFP technologies could limit technology transfer. In the United States, Panasonic – historically Tesla’s main battery partner – remained the country’s largest battery producer in 2024, accounting for nearly half of the electric car market. However, its share is declining as Korean producers like LG Energy Solution, Samsung and SKI invest heavily in the US market. Tesla also ramped up its own battery production in 2024, primarily for use in the Cybertruck. Global EV Outlook 2025 Electric vehicle batteries PAGE | 142 Battery production in the United States is expanding rapidly, spurred by the implementation of tax credits. Manufacturing capacity has doubled since 2022, reaching more than 200 GWh in 2024, with nearly 700 GWh of additional capacity under construction. Around 40% of existing and committed capacity is being operated or developed by established battery makers in close collaboration with automakers. Nevertheless, the cost of production remains higher than in Asia, if not accounting for incentives, and sudden policy shifts could affect the emerging US battery industry, increase production costs, or slow expansion in the near to medium term.

However, recent analyses indicate that sodium-ion batteries will require either increased energy density or more favourable operating conditions – particularly higher lithium prices – to compete with LFP batteries on a price per kWh basis. Nevertheless, sodium-ion technologies could play a significant role during times of elevated lithium prices and may offer a cheaper option for batteries in cold climates, where LFP batteries typically perform less well. In 2024, solid-state batteries moved closer to commercial reality with new large prototypes and manufacturing investments from Samsung SDI, Toyota, NIO, Honda, Quantum Scape, BASQUEVOLT, and Factorial, among others, and the creation of a government-led Chinese battery alliance, including large producers such as CATL, BYD, SAIC and Geely, to accelerate solid-state battery development. Despite this, their potential advantages, including enabling higher ranges and safety, still need to be demonstrated for battery packs manufactured at scale and tested under controlled, realistic and standardised conditions. The technology readiness level (TRL) of solid-state batteries therefore remains at large pilot stage (TRL 6), although this could change rapidly with companies like Toyota and BYD planning first mass production by 2027-2028. However, volumes will be limited initially, and it will take several years following roll-out for solid-state batteries to eventually become competitive with lithium-ion batteries. Additionally, “solid-state batteries” is often used as a generic term covering a range of options between fully solid-state and incumbent lithium-ion batteries, which creates some confusion. The first “solid-state batteries” to be commercialised might be semi- or quasi-solid-state batteries – for example using gel-like electrolyte2 or incorporating small volumes of liquid electrolytes – as they could help address some scale-up challenges and reduce production costs. Lithium-sulphur (Li-S) batteries, promising higher specific energy (Wh/kg) and lower reliance on critical minerals, have also gained momentum. The US start-up Lyten announced the world’s first Li-S gigafactory, while Stellantis partnered with Zeta to commercialise this technology by 2030. However, several challenges remain, including improving volumetric energy density (Wh/L), enhancing 2 French company Blue Solutions already markets a semi-solid-state battery using lithium metal anode and a gel electrolyte that requires the battery to be heated during use, and plans to invest more than EUR 2 billion in a factory in France by 2030. Global EV Outlook 2025 Electric vehicle batteries PAGE | 144 durability, and addressing safety concerns related to the use of lithium metal anodes. Overcoming these hurdles will be key to enabling real-world applications. Advances in battery recycling are also being made, for example combining pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy processes, increasing the recovery efficiency of reactive metals such as lithium, recycling the graphite in the anodes, or through the development of new recycling approaches, such as electrochemical extraction. However, recycling feedstock availability remains limited, restricting the impact of recycling in the short term (see Box below). Options for battery reuse at the end of their first life for less demanding applications are also under development, with the majority of companies in the sector based in Europe. However, the economic viability of reuse is complicated by upstream competition from recyclers looking for access to end-of-life batteries, downstream competition from the falling prices of new batteries, and challenges associated with battery dismantling and repurposing while ensuring strict safety standards.

Second-hand EV markets may play a larger role in supporting reuse and also increasing affordability. Innovation extends far beyond battery chemistries, and the already broad landscape of battery innovation is getting even broader.3 In 2023 and 2024, there was a remarkable surge in improvements for incumbent lithium-ion batteries, from superfast charging and “no-degradation” batteries to ultra-energy-dense batteries and new charging platforms, manufacturing processes, cell formats and pack designs, among others. Advances in manufacturing are also notable: for example, artificial intelligence for image analysis can enable the early detection of battery defects and their root causes, thereby improving production yields and reducing scrap rates. This capability is critical for scaling up production given the pace of modern gigafactories – a 50 GWh facility can produce up to 10 million (cylindrical) or hundreds of thousands (prismatic) EV battery cells per day.4 The nature and pace of innovations in legacy technologies are already making a big impact on the market, posing a formidable challenge for emerging technologies to compete. 3 See IEA (2025) State of Energy Innovation for deeper insights into how this landscape is evolving. 4 Assuming an average plant utilisation factor of 85% over the year, a cell voltage of 4 volts, and a cell capacity of 60 ampere hours (prismatic) and 3 ampere hours (cylindrical). Global EV Outlook 2025 Electric vehicle batteries PAGE | 145 Battery recycling is important, but its benefits will take time to materialise Battery recycling is crucial for the battery industry’s long-term sustainability, and is being promoted by industry organisations and governments through dedicated investments and regulations. For instance, the EU Batteries Regulation sets requirements for minimum recycling efficiency and recycled contents that will increase progressively. Recycled battery metals such as nickel, cobalt and lithium can incur 80% less GHG emissions than primary materials produced from mining and refining, while also reducing local environmental impacts, including water use and biodiversity loss near mines. In addition to sustainability, governments are prioritising supply chain security. Recycling can enhance resilience for consumer countries without direct access to battery minerals, but only if there is a simultaneous development of the midstream battery supply chain, particularly the cathode active material (CAM) industry. To realise the security benefits, end-of-life batteries must be recycled, and the recovered minerals processed and utilised domestically, or in a partner country, to produce CAMs for batteries. However, the CAM industry is progressing more slowly than the battery industry in Europe and the United States. In the absence of a domestic industry, the recycled minerals would need to be exported for processing and then reimported as CAMs, or within batteries or EVs, thereby forfeiting the supply chain security advantage. Recycling industries in Europe and North America have focused on NMC batteries – the main chemistry used for electric cars in these regions, but advances in LFP batteries are now making them more attractive outside of China, where LFP already leads the EV battery market. The rise of cheaper batteries such as LFP poses a challenge to the economic viability of battery recycling, which requires sufficiently high concentrations of valuable minerals in batteries to be profitable. Nevertheless, this does not preclude LFP battery recyclability, and NMC recycling facilities can be modified to process LFP batteries, though this might require different business models. Toll-based models – through the implementation of gate fees – can ensure the economic viability of LFP recycling, especially when lithium prices are low. Regulations would need to define how these toll fees are distributed to guarantee the proper management of all end-of-life batteries. It will take time for the battery recycling industry to significantly affect primary mineral demand, as feedstock remains limited and EV batteries may last longer than previously expected. End-of-life EV and storage batteries are expected to account for only one-third of recyclable feedstock by 2030 and even less in the interim, with manufacturing scraps making up the rest. It will require about a decade for end-of-life batteries to become the main feedstock. In 2035, if countries fulfil their announced climate pledges, recycling would reduce global primary demand for cobalt by over 15% (40% in 2050), and for lithium and nickel by only about 5% (25% in 2050).

Global EV Outlook 2025 Electric vehicle batteries PAGE | 146 Battery production and trade The battery market is being reshaped by two distinct trends: increasing consolidation, and government-led efforts to geographically diversify battery supply chains. Whereas markets used to be regionalised and small, they are now global and very large, and uncertainty over technological development is giving way to standardisation. In this new phase, economies of scale, partnerships along the supply chain, manufacturing efficiency, and the capacity to bring innovations swiftly to market will be even more crucial for manufacturers to remain competitive. The battery supply chain remains geographically concentrated The EV and battery supply chain becomes increasingly geographically concentrated when moving upstream from car manufacturing to battery cell and component production. China was responsible for 80% of global battery cell production in 2024, while the remainder was produced in the United States, the European Union, Korea and Japan. Importantly, the production of lithium-ion battery manufacturing equipment is also highly concentrated, with China, Korea, and Japan leading the market. China has also established a near monopoly on battery components production, supplying almost 85% of cathode active materials – including NMC and LFP chemistries – and over 90% of anode active material production, predominantly graphite. Outside of China, only Korea and Japan offer sizeable production capacity for cathode components. Korea also produces anodes, and Indonesia is expected to bring some diversification to the market. Nonetheless, China is set to remain the largest producer of batteries and their components by some distance in the medium term, based on announced projects and competitive advantages. The geographical concentration of battery mineral mining and refining needed for battery cathodes and anodes is also a concern. In 2023, Australia, Chile and China mined about 85% of global lithium, with almost 65% refined in China and another 25% in Chile. Indonesia accounted for over half of nickel mining in 2023, while China and Indonesia together refined more than 60%. In the same year, the Democratic Republic of Congo was home to almost two-thirds of the world’s cobalt mining, though three-quarters of all cobalt refining was handled in China. Graphite supply, the only critical mineral used for anodes today, is even more concentrated, with China responsible for 80% of mining and over 90% of refining.

This expansion would lead global manufacturing capacity to grow to about 6.5 TWh (and more than 9 TWh if accounting for all announcements), up from 3.3 TWh in 2024, and reduce China’s share of global manufacturing capacity to about two-thirds by 2030, down from 85% in 2024.

Global EV Outlook 2025 Outlook for energy demand PAGE | 152 8. Outlook for energy demand Electricity demand Electric vehicles could account for more than 4% of European electricity demand by 2030 In 2024, the global fleet of EVs consumed around 180 TWh of electricity,1 almost 60% more than the previous year. To put this in perspective, 180 TWh is more than the annual electricity consumption of Argentina. At the global level, EVs represented about 0.7% of final electricity consumption in 2024. The stock of EVs is set to more than triple to 2030, but electricity demand could increase more than fourfold, reaching 780 TWh in the STEPS. This is driven by increasing consumption from electric trucks, as well as greater EV uptake in markets where people drive more per year. Total energy demand for road transport increases by only 5% in 2030 in the STEPS, while total road activity (in terms of vehicle kilometres travelled) increases by almost 20% during the same period, reflecting the greater energy efficiency of EVs.

In China in 2024, LDVs were responsible for only around 55% of road electricity demand, and this remains the same in 2030 in the STEPS, illustrating China’s success in EV adoption across a range of applications. In contrast, over 90% of electricity demand for road in the United States came from electric cars in 2024, though this falls to around 75% in 2030 in the STEPS, as demand from electric buses and commercial vehicles picks up. In Europe, the increasing number of electric heavyduty trucks means their share of road transport electricity demand increases from less than 5% to more than 20% in 2030 in the STEPS. In both China and Europe, the share of electricity demand from EVs reached the milestone of 1% in 2024. By 2030 in the STEPS, the share of electricity for EVs in Europe exceeds the share in China, as electricity demand for other end uses, such as industry and buildings, grows faster in China than in Europe.

Oil displacement by region and mode in the Stated Policies Scenario, 2024-2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Notes: Oil displacement is based on internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle fuel consumption to cover the same mileage as the electric vehicle (EV) fleet. Oil displacement is calculated by assuming that the distance (total kilometres) travelled by EVs by segment each year would have been otherwise travelled by ICE vehicles or hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). In the case of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), where the powertrain uses both oil-based fuel and electricity, only the distance covered by electricity is included. This method of estimation assumes that EVs replace ICE or hybrid vehicles of the same segment, and that these vehicles follow the same driving behaviour. The accuracy of this assumption is uncertain; there is some evidence to suggest that EVs are driven further than their ICE counterparts, for example. Governments will need to adapt tax policies to ensure both future revenues and growth of electrification One of the primary financial challenges of vehicle electrification for governments is the resulting reduction in revenue from fossil fuel taxes. While efficiency improvements in ICEs have already had an impact on tax receipts, the fuel shift could lead to a further decline in tax income. Although EV drivers contribute to additional revenue through electricity taxes, this remains insufficient to fully compensate for the loss in gasoline and diesel tax income. In 2024, electricity tax revenue increased by nearly 50% to reach more than USD 2.5 billion globally, while gasoline and diesel tax revenues accounted for USD 560 billion. As the global EV stock continues to rise, fossil fuel tax revenue is projected to decrease significantly to nearly USD 520 billion by 2030 in the STEPS, while electricity tax revenue grows to over USD 10 billion. If the decline in fossil fuel tax revenue is not compensated with alternative taxation measures, the effect of electrification displacing gasoline and diesel would result in a net tax 2030 Light-duty vehicle Truck Bus Two/three-wheeler -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 2024 mb/d China Europe United States India Rest of World By region: By mode: By region By mode Global EV Outlook 2025 Outlook for energy demand PAGE | 155 shortfall for governments reaching more than USD 65 billion globally by 2030.

However, the increase in China’s electricity tax revenue due to vehicle fleet electrification would nearly fully offset the loss. In Europe, which sees the largest decrease in fossil fuel tax revenue, the net impact of electrification is expected to result in a tax revenue decline of USD 40 billion in the STEPS by 2030. In the United States, fossil fuel tax revenue is projected to increase by USD 0.1 billion due to slow electrification and growth in the overall vehicle fleet. Meanwhile, the rest of the world is set to experience an increase in combined fossil fuel and electricity tax revenue totalling around USD 6.5 billion by the end of the decade, driven by expected growth in both ICEs and EVs.

To stabilise tax revenues, Norway, a world leader on electromobility, with nearly 90% share of car sales being battery electric in 2024, introduced a vehicle weight tax of NOK 12.08 Norwegian kroner (USD 1.1) per kilogramme on BEVs, generating 1.5 3.0 4.5 2030 Billion USD China Europe United States Rest of World Electricity 110 330 2030 Gasoline and diesel Global EV Outlook 2025 Outlook for energy demand PAGE | 156 around USD 0.15 billion in 2024. Prior to this, in 2023, Norway introduced a 25% VAT rate on BEVs priced at more than NOK 500 000 (around USD 46 000), and estimates having earned around (USD 0.14 billion) in 2024 from this new VAT tax measure. However, maintaining the VAT exemption for battery electric cars priced below NOK 500 000 resulted in revenue loss of around NOK 13 billion (USD 1.2 billion). Prior to 2025, the United Kingdom waived vehicle excise duty (VED) for electric, zero, or low-emission cars, vans and motorcycles. From 1 April 2025, however, new electric cars are taxed GBP 10 (USD 13) in the first year and the standard rate, GBP 195 (around USD 255), in subsequent years. This measure boosts government coffers by nearly USD 3 billion by 2030 in the STEPS. Considering the gain from EV VED alongside the reduction in VED from ICE vehicles, the net tax increase from total car VED is projected to reach more than USD 1 billion by 2030. Another option open to policy makers could be taxing vehicles based on efficiency, rather than imposing a flat rate, which would mean owners of less efficient, older vehicles bear a higher tax burden. While this could further incentivise EV growth, it might disproportionally affect people in lower-income demographics who are more likely to own an older vehicle, potentially reducing the public acceptance of electromobility in the long-term. Similarly, there is a risk of public pushback in response to the introduction of taxes on EVs to cover fuel excise duty losses. To minimise this risk, any tax reform will need to be designed in a way that protects low-income households, while avoiding penalising early EV adopters. As the shift towards EVs continues, it will be essential for governments to introduce tax measures that gradually address the revenue gap while continuing to incentivise a just transition to a low-emissions transport system. .

The “high cost” case corresponds to the scenario where the total cost of ownership is expected to be the highest. The “payload penalty” is calculated in a previous table of this Annex. HRS fill rate and charging power impact the total cost of ownership via the “dwell costs”, which is the financial penalty incurred when refuelling takes longer than the minimum rest period. In the case of charging power the capital costs also vary. Global EV Outlook 2025 Annex PAGE | 165 Driving and refuelling profile The daily driving range is assumed to be 500 km, where half of the daily distance is travelled before the driver’s rest period and the other half afterwards. It is assumed that all truck types refuel during the rest periods. Regulations require rest periods durations of 20, 30, and 45 minutes in China, the United States, and the European Union, respectively. It is assumed that the diesel trucks can sufficiently refuel within the rest periods, and thus incur no dwell costs (see below for how dwell costs are calculated for battery electric and fuel cell electric trucks). En route charging is assumed to occur with 350 kW chargers. Battery electric trucks are also assumed to charge overnight, up to 10 hours, using a 50 kW (peak) charger. It is assumed that the trucks can operate seven days per week, fortyeight weeks per year for a total of 168 000 km travelled per year. Dwell costs for battery electric trucks Maximum and minimum charge levels of 20% and 80% are maintained to preserve battery health and for enhanced safety. Battery electric trucks are assumed to charge for the full length of their rest period and during their stay in depot. If required, the battery electric truck remains charging after the rest period until the state of charge is sufficient to complete the remaining 250 km to return to depot, charge overnight at the depot, and then complete the 250 km required to reach the rest period the following day. This additional daily charging, if required, is multiplied by labour cost to give the dwell cost. Financing period and additional considerations The truck is purchased with a 100% loan at 5% interest. A discount rate of 8% is applied throughout. The analysis takes into account the first 5 years after the purchase of the truck, equivalent to a total distance travelled of 840 000 km. Diesel trucks have a residual value of 26% throughout, BEV and FCEV trucks are assumed to also have a 26% residual value when purchased in 2024 and 33% if purchased in 2030, after haven driven comparable distances over that period to those modelled in this analysis.

Sales of electric vehicles (EVs) doubled in 2021 from the previous year to a new record of 6.6 million. Back in 2012, just 120 000 electric cars were sold worldwide. In 2021, more than that many are sold each week. Nearly 10% of global car sales were electric in 2021, four times the market share in 2019. This brought the total number of electric cars on the world’s roads to about 16.5 million, triple the amount in 2018. Global sales of electric cars have kept rising strongly in 2022, with 2 million sold in the first quarter, up 75% from the same period in 2021. The success of EVs is being driven by multiple factors. Sustained policy support is the main pillar. Public spending on subsidies and incentives for EVs nearly doubled in 2021 to nearly USD 30 billion. A growing number of countries have pledged to phase out internal combution engines or have ambitious vehicle electrification targets for the coming decades. Meanwhile, many carmakers have plans to electrify their fleets that go further than policy targets. Finally, five times more new EV models were available in 2021 than in 2015, increasing the attractiveness for consumers. The number of EV models available on the market is around 450. The increase in EV sales in 2021 was primarily led by the People’s Republic of China (“China”), which accounted for half of the growth. More vehicles were sold in China in 2021 (3.3 million) than in the entire world in 2020. Sales in Europe showed continued robust growth (up 65% to 2.3 million) after the 2020 boom, and they increased in the United States as well (to 630 000) after two years of decline. The first quarter of 2022 showed similar trends, with sales in China more than doubling compared with the first quarter of 2021 (accounting for most of global growth), a 60% increase in the United States and a 25% increase in Europe. In China, electric cars are typically smaller than in other markets. This, alongside lower development and manufacturing costs, has contributed to decreasing the price gap with conventional cars. In 2021, the sales-weighted median price of EVs in China was only 10% more than that of conventional offerings, compared with 45-50% on average in other major markets. China accounts for 95% of new registrations of electric two- and three-wheeler vehicles and 90% of new electric bus and truck registrations worldwide. Electric two-"}

Electric two- and three-wheeler vehicles now account for half of China’s sales. The speed of charging infrastructure roll-out in China is faster than in most other regions. By contrast, EV sales are still lagging in other emerging and developing economies, where the few models that are available remain unaffordable for mass-market consumers. In Brazil, India and Indonesia, fewer than 0.5% of car sales are electric. However, EV sales doubled in a number of regions in 2021 – including in India– Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 5 Executive Summary which could pave the way for quicker market uptake by 2030 if supporting investments and policies are in place. Sales keep rising, but much more needs to be done to support charging infrastructure and heavy-duty vehicles The Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s war in Ukraine have disrupted global supply chains, and the car industry has been heavily impacted. In the near future, EV delivery delays to customers may dampen sales growth in some markets. But in the longer term, government and corporate efforts to electrify transport are providing a solid basis for further growth in EV sales. The IEA Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), which is based on existing climate-focused policy pledges and announcements, presumes that EVs represent more than 30% of vehicles sold globally in 2030 across all modes (excluding two- and three-wheelers). While impressive, this is still well short of the 60% share needed by 2030 to align with a trajectory that would reach net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. Under current policy plans reflected in the IEA Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), EVs reach just over 20% of sales in 2030, increasing the stock 11-fold from today’s levels to 200 million vehicles. The global market value of electricity for EV charging is projected to grow over 20-fold in the APS, reaching approximately USD 190 billion by 2030, which is is equivalent to about one-tenth of today’s diesel and gasoline market value. Yet, the amount of public charging infrastructure that has been announced might be insufficient to power the size of the EV market being targeted. There are important variations across countries in terms of charging infrastructure roll-out speed and need. The suitable number of chargers per EV will depend on local specificities such as housing stock, typical travel distances, population density and reliance on home charging. Charging at home and workplace are likely to supply much of the demand overall, but the number of public chargers still needs to expand ninefold and reach over 15 million units in 2030 to meet the levels envisaged in the APS and provide consumers with adequate and convenient coverage. Electric trucks have so far been substantially deployed only in China, thanks to strong government support. In 2021, however, several other countries announced support for heavy truck electrification. Truck manufacturers have also developed new electric truck models: more than 170 were available outside China in 2021. Rapid deployment will be needed to keep pace with government announcements, and further efforts will be needed to meet net zero ambitions. The electric trucks accounted for just 0.3% of global truck sales in 2021. This needs to reach around 10% by 2030 in the APS, and 25% in the IEA’s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE). Short-haul trucks are the segment that can be electrified fastest, and for the most part these do not need a wide charging network if depot charging is available. Longer-range trucks will require high-power chargers that are currently expensive and often require significant grid upgrades. As a result, early planning and investments are crucial Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 6 Executive Summary to minimise the strain on the grid and provide a suitable network for the next stage of heavy-duty vehicle electrification. The simultaneous electrification of road transport and the deployment of decentralised variable renewables such as rooftop solar will make power grid distribution more complex to manage. Grid simulations suggest that between now and 2030, EV loads in major car markets should not pose significant challenges. This is because EVs are likely to account for less than 20% of the overall vehicle stock in most countries. However, some early adopter cities could face grid congestion pressures between now and 2030. Digital"}

However, some early adopter cities could face grid congestion pressures between now and 2030. Digital grid technologies and smart charging hold the key to transforming EVs from a grid integration challenge to an opportunity for grid management. Electrifying transport helps address air pollution, oil import dependency and climate change Electrifying transport has multiple benefits. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought the role of EVs in reducing oil demand to the fore; it is one of the 10 measures proposed by the IEA to cut oil use in the near term. EV deployment in line with the pledges and announcements in the APS suggests a displacement (excluding two and three wheelers) of 1.6 million barrels per day (mb/d) of oil by 2025, and 4.6 mb/d by 2030. In terms of climate change, EVs achieve net greenhouse gas emissions reduction of nearly 580 Mt CO2-eq in the APS on a well-to-wheel basis compared to an equivalent use of ICE vehicles – more than Canada’s energy-related CO2 emissions today. Electrifying transport naturally boosts electricity demand: in the APS, EVs are projected to account for about 4% of total final electricity demand by 2030. At 1 100 terawatt-hours (TWh), electricity demand from EVs globally in 2030 in the APS is equivalent to twice today’s total electricity use in Brazil. Focus is on critical minerals as battery markets expand The rapid increase in EV sales during the pandemic has tested the resilience of battery supply chains, and Russia’s war in Ukraine has further exacerbated the challenge. Prices of raw materials such as cobalt, lithium and nickel have surged. In May 2022, lithium prices were over seven times higher than at the start of 2021. Unprecedented battery demand and a lack of structural investment in new supply capacity are key factors. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has created further pressures, since Russia supplies 20% of global highpurity nickel. Average battery prices fell by 6% to USD 132 per kilowatt-hour in 2021, a slower decline than the 13% drop the previous year. If metal prices in 2022 remain as high as in the first quarter, battery packs would become 15% more expensive than they were in 2021, all else being equal. However, given the current oil price environment the relative competitiveness of EVs remains unaffected. Today’s battery supply chains are concentrated around China, which produces three-quarters of all lithium-ion batteries and is home to 70% of production capacity for cathodes and 85% of production Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 7 Executive Summary capacity for anodes (both are key components of batteries). Over half of lithium, cobalt and graphite processing and refining capacity is located in China. Europe is responsible for over one-quarter of global EV production, but it is home to very little of the supply chain apart from cobalt processing at 20%. The United States has an even smaller role in the global EV battery supply chain, with only 10% of EV production and 7% of battery production capacity. Both Korea and Japan have considerable shares of the supply chain downstream of raw material processing, particularly in the highly technical cathode and anode material production, Korea is responsible for 15% of cathode material production capacity, while Japan accounts for 14% of cathode and 11% of anode material production. Korean and Japanese companies are also involved in the production of other battery components such as separators. Mining generally takes place in resource-rich countries such as Australia, Chile and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and is handled by a few major companies. Governments in Europe and the United States have bold public sector initiatives to develop domestic battery supply chains, but the majority of the supply chain is likely to remain Chinese through 2030. For example, 70% of battery production capacity announced for the period to 2030 is in China. Pressure on the supply of critical materials will continue to mount as road transport electrification expands to meet net zero ambitions. Additional investments are needed in the short term, particularly in mining, where lead times are much longer than for other parts of the supply chain.

Additional investments are needed in the short term, particularly in mining, where lead times are much longer than for other parts of the supply chain. Projected mineral supply until the end of the 2020s is in line with the demand for EV batteries in the STEPS. But the supply of some minerals such as lithium would need to rise by up to onethird by 2030 to match the demand for EV batteries to satisfy the pledges and announcements in the APS. For example, demand for lithium – the commodity with the largest projected demand-supply gap – is projected to increase sixfold to 500 kilotonnes by 2030 in the APS, requiring the equivalent of 50 new average-sized mines. There are other variables affecting demand for minerals. If current high commodity prices endure, cathode chemistries could shift towards less mineral-intensive options. For example, the lithium iron phosphate chemistry does not require nickel nor cobalt, but comes with a lower energy density and is therefore better suited for shorterrange vehicles. Their share of global EV battery supply has more than doubled since 2020 because of high mineral prices and technology innovation, primarily driven by an increasing uptake in China. Innovation in new chemistries, such as manganese-rich cathodes or even sodium-ion, could further reduce the pressure on mining. Recycling can also reduce demand for minerals. Although the impact between now and 2030 is likely to be small, recycling’s contribution to moderating mineral demand is critical after 2030. In the NZE Scenario, demand grows even faster, requiring additional demandside measures and technology innovation. Today’s corporate and consumer preferrence for large car models such as sports utility vehicles (SUVs), which account for half of all electric models available globally and require larger batteries to travel the same distances, is exerting additional pressure. Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 8 Executive Summary Five recommendations to accelerate the uptake of EVs worldwide 1 – Maintain and adapt support for electric cars As the electric car market matures, reliance on direct subsidies must decrease and eventually fade out. Budget-neutral feebate programmes – which tax inefficient internal combustion engine vehicles to finance subsidies for low emissions or EVs purchases – can be a useful transition policy tool. Stringent vehicle efficiency and/or CO2 standards have promoted EV adoption in most leading EV markets and should be adopted by all countries seeking to hasten the transition to electromobility. 2- Kickstart the heavy-duty market More heavy-duty electric models are available, and electric buses and trucks are becoming competitive on a total-cost-of-ownership basis across more and more applications. Policy-led deployment can help kickstart this sector. Zero emission vehicle sales mandates, purchase incentives and CO2 standards can all help speed up the transition. 3- Promote adoption in emerging and developing economies Electrification of road transport in emerging and developing economies should prioritise two/three-wheelers and urban buses, as these vehicle types are most cost competitive. Price signals and charging infrastructure availability can also help the economic case for electrification. 4- Expand EV infrastructure and smart grids Governments should continue to support deployment of publicly available charging infrastructure at least until there are enough EVs on the road for an operator to sustain a charging network. Continued government support, either through regulations requiring the building out of charging stations or through fiscal policies and support, should ensure equitable access to charging for all communities to ensure that nobody is left behind in the transition. Incentivising and facilitating the installation of home chargers in existing parking spaces is important. Mandating EV charging readiness for new buildings can help. At the same time, local authorities should support the installation of chargers in existing buildings. Co-ordinated plans on grid expansion and enhancements, including digital technologies to facilitate two-way communication and pricing between EVs and grids, are needed now to ensure that EVs can become a resource for grid stability rather than a challenge. Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 9 Executive Summary 5- Ensure secure, resilient and sustainable EV supply chains Electrifying road transport requires a wide range of raw material inputs. While all stages of the supply chain must scale up, extraction and processing is particularly critical due to long lead times. Governments must leverage private investment in sustainable mining of key battery metals and ensure clear and rapid permitting procedures to avoid potential supply bottlenecks. Innovation and alternative chemistries that require smaller amounts of critical minerals, as well as extensive battery recycling, can ease demand pressure and avoid bottlenecks. Incentivising battery “rightsizing” and the adoption of smaller cars can also decrease demand for critical metals. Governments should"}

Governments should strengthen cooperation between producer and consumer countries to facilitate investment, promote environmentally and socially sustainable practices, and encourage knowledge sharing. Governments should ensure traceability of key EV components and monitor progress of ambitious environmental and social development goals at every stage of battery and EV supply chains.. Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 10 Electric Vehicles Initiative Electric Vehicles Initiative Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 11 Electric Vehicles Initiative Electric Vehicles Initiative aims to accelerate EV deployment The Electric Vehicles Initiative (EVI) is a multi-governmental policy forum established in 2010 under the Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM). Recognising the opportunities offered by EVs, the EVI is dedicated to accelerating the adoption of EVs worldwide. To do so, it strives to better understand the policy challenges related to electric mobility, help governments address them and to serve as a platform for knowledge sharing. The EVI facilitates exchanges between government policy makers that are committed to supporting EV development and a variety of partners, bringing them together twice a year. Its multilateral nature, openness to various stakeholders and engagement at different levels of governance (from country to city-level) offer friutful opportunities to exchange information and to learn from experiences developed by a range of actors in the transition to electric mobility. The International Energy Agency serves as the co-ordinator to support the EVI member governments in this activity. Governments that have been active in the EVI in the 2020-21 period include Canada, Chile, People’s Republic of China (hereafter “China”), Finland, France, Germany, India, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, United Kingdom and United States. Canada and China are the co-leads of the initiative. The Global EV Outlook annual series is the flagship publication of the EVI. It is dedicated to track and monitor the progress of electric mobility worldwide and to inform policy makers on how to best accelerate electrification of the road transport sector..

Looking back, about 120 000 electric cars were sold worldwide in 2012. In 2021, that many were sold in a week. After increasing in 2020 despite a depressed car market, sales of electric cars – battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) – nearly doubled year-on-year to 6.6 million in 2021.1 This brought the total number of electric cars on roads to over 16.5 million. As in previous years, BEVs accounted for most of the increase (about 70%). EV markets are expanding quickly. Electric car sales accounted for 9% of the global car market in 2021 – four times their market share in 2019. All the net growth in global car sales in 2021 came from electric cars. Sales were highest in the People’s Republic of China (“China” hereafter), where they tripled relative to 2020 to 3.3 million after several years of relative stagnation, and in Europe, where they increased by two-thirds year-on-year to 2.3 million. Together, China and Europe accounted for more than 85% of global electric car sales 1 This report focuses on BEVs and PHEVs, i.e. EVs that are powered with electricity from the grid. All figures and discussion exclude fuel cell electric vehicles unless otherwise specified. in 2021, followed by the United States (10%), where they more than doubled from 2020 to reach 630 000. China accelerates EV vehicle deployment as a new five-year plan sets more ambitious objectives More electric cars were sold in China in 2021 (3.3 million) than in the entire world in 2020 (3.0 million). China’s fleet of electric cars remained the world’s largest at 7.8 million in 2021, which is more than double the stock of 2019 before the Covid-19 pandemic. Over 2.7 million BEVs were sold in China in 2021, accounting for 82% of new electric car sales. Electric cars accounted for 16% of domestic car sales in 2021, up from 5% in 2020, and reached a monthly share of 20% in December, reflecting a much quicker recovery of EV markets relative to conventional cars. This impressive growth comes alongside government efforts to accelerate decarbonisation in the new 14th Five-Year Plan (FYP) (2021-2025), continuing the trend of progressively strengthening policy support for EV markets in the past few FYP periods. The current FYP includes medium-term objectives in transport such as Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 17 Trends and developments in EV markets reaching an annual average of 20% market share for electric car sales in 2025. Notably, China had extended subsidies for electric cars for two years in the wake of the pandemic, with a planned scale-back of 20% in 2021 and 30% in 2022 – but by the end of 2022 they will be phased out. There are also a number of subnational regulations that give preferential treatment to EVs, such as local subsidies or tax breaks, financial incentives and exemptions from purchase limitations. Growth in 2021 in spite of declining subsidies indicates the maturing of China’s EV markets. Consumer anticipation of declining subsidies may also have supported record high sales, although the pace at which subsidies effectively decline warrants further examination. China’s electric car market can be expected to further expand in 2022 and beyond, as investments from previous years ramp up production capacity and bear fruit. Europe sustains strong growth after its 2020 boom, reaching the world’s highest electric car penetration rates In Europe, electric car sales continued to increase in 2021 by more than 65% year-on-year to 2.3 million, after the boom of 2020. EV sales remained strong even though the overall automotive market has not yet fully recovered from the pandemic: total car sales in 2021 were 25% lower than in 2019. Over the 2016-2021 period, EV sales in Europe increased by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 61%, the world’s highest, above China (58%) and the United States (32%). Overall, electric cars accounted for 17% of Europe’s auto sales in 2021."}

Overall, electric cars accounted for 17% of Europe’s auto sales in 2021. Monthly sales were highest in the last quarter, when electric car reached a 27% sales share and surpassed diesel vehicles for the first time. However, the distribution is uneven across countries. The largest market in terms of number of EVs sold remains Germany, where electric cars accounted for 25% of new cars sold overall, which increased to one-in-three in November and December. Germany offers some of the highest subsidies in Europe. The highest market share for new electric car sales in 2021 in Europe are Norway (86%), Iceland (72%), Sweden (43%) and the Netherlands (30%), followed by France (19%), Italy (9%) and Spain (8%). For the first time in 2021, the bigger market of the United Kingdom was not included in European Union-wide regulations, although it has put in place national law that mirrors EU regulations. The key driver underpinning EV growth in Europe is the tightening CO2 emissions standards that occurred in 2020 and 2021. The expansion of purchase subsidies and tax benefits in major markets also contributed to the acceleration of sales. In 2021, there were about 5.5 million electric cars on European roads – more than three-times the stock of 2019 before the Covid-19 Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 18 Trends and developments in EV markets outbreak. As in previous years, new sales were evenly split between BEVs and PHEVs, in contrast to China where BEVs typically score a clear lead. In 2021, Europe’s stock of electric cars was about 55% BEVs, a share that has remained steady since 2015 and is lower than other regions such as China (80%) and the United States (65%). This may reflect a corporate strategy among European automakers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of offering PHEV versions of many large and high-end car models to capitalise on their experience in developing conventional drivetrains (a necessary part of PHEVs), whereas their experience in electric powertrains is more recent. In addition, the CO2 regulation structure in Europe makes PHEVs very attractive for OEMs in terms of compliance. A new wave of electric car uptake in the United States After two years of consecutive decline of 10%, electric car sales increased in the United States in 2021. About 630 000 electric cars were sold – more than in 2019 and 2020 combined – bringing the total stock of electric cars to over 2 million. About 75% of new EV sales were BEVs, up from 55% just five years ago, resulting in a higher share of BEVs relative to PHEVs today over the total EV stock (65%) than in 2015-2016 (about 50%). Relative to other regions, the overall car market recovered faster from the pandemic in the United States, but electric cars still doubled their share to 4.5% in 2021. Tesla accounts for over half of all units sold, and there are generally fewer models available in the United States than in other major markets. Some of the main drivers underpinning growth in the United States in 2021 were the increased production of Tesla models and the availability of new generation electric models by incumbent automakers.

Over the 20152021 period, the CAGR for new models was 34%. The increase in the number of available EV car models is associated with a notable increase in sale volumes in all markets. This reflects the interests of automakers to capture EV market share by producing new options quickly to appeal to an broadening pool of consumers. As in previous years, China offers the broadest portfolio, with nearly 300 models available, compared with 184 in Europe and nearly 65 in the United States. Thanks to consistently high electric car sales, Chinese automakers have been able to diversify offerings and market a larger number of products over the years. Availability increased in all major markets relative to 2020, but increased more in Europe (26%) and the United States (24%) than in China (13%) as these markets catch up. Automakers and consumers continue to prefer SUVs In 2021, global sales of conventional sport utility vehicles (SUVs) marked another record, setting back efforts to reduce emissions. This development is also seen in EV markets. SUVs and luxury models typically generate much larger profit margins, which is one reason why automakers promote them and boost supply. About half of the electric car models available in major markets in 2021 were SUVs, far ahead of small (10%) or medium-size models (23%). Small models found most success in China (13% of available models), with the example of the best-selling Wuling Hongguang Mini EV, and least in the United States (2%). In China, there were more than ten new offerings for small and medium cars relative to 2020 (up 13%), versus 22 new models offered for larger models and SUVs (up 13% as well). Meanwhile, there were many more new offerings for large models and SUVs in Europe and the United States – about 50 in total – than for small and medium EVs, hence the number of models available in these segments increased disproportionately. While smaller electric car models are BEVs for the most part, the share of PHEVs in larger models and SUVs is higher, especially in Europe and the United States. This may result from automakers discontinuing some high power, luxury conventional vehicle models to offer these as PHEVs instead. In 2022 and beyond, expectations are for even more electric SUVs to reach markets as automakers and OEMs accelerate efforts to electrify this fast growing segment to simultaneously seek profits from larger models and comply with Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 21 Trends and developments in EV markets policy and market regulations. This is expected to result in even higher demand for large battery designs and the raw materials to produce them. BEV and PHEV driving range is increasing, albeit slowly Over the 2015-2019 period, the sales-weighted average range of new BEVs increased steadily at a 12% annual growth rate on average, but then stagnated in 2019-2020, and only moderately increased in 2021 (up 3.5%), to reach 350 kilometres (km). The CAGR over the 2015-2021 period remained high at 9%, reflecting sustained efforts to improve vehicle efficiency and increase battery size. The salesweighted average driving range of new PHEVs increased by 8.5% in 2021 and exceeded 60 km for the first time, after several years of relative slow growth, resulting in a 2.7% CAGR over the 2015-2021 period. This increase in part is due to the availability of new PHEV models equipped with larger batteries and thus lower rated CO2 emissions. Driving range remains an important consideration for consumers. Automakers typically aim for longer ranges to boost sales. On the other hand, increasing driving range typically implies larger batteries, increased resource needs and higher prices. In the long run, driving range is likely to plateau, as a market optimal vehicle range is reached and fast charging becomes more widely available.

China, Europe and the United States account for nearly twothirds of the overall electric car market and their aggregated sales represented 95% of total electric car sales in 2021. In large economies such as Brazil, India and Indonesia, EVs account for less than 0.5% of total sales, with some growth over the last years, albeit from low sales levels. There were positive developments in 2021, however, possibly signalling stronger prospects. Electric car sales in emerging markets spiked to unprecedented levels in 2021: more than doubling in Asia to 33 000; in Eastern Europe, Central and West Asia to 32 000; and in Latin America and the Caribbean to 18 000. In Eastern Europe, Central and West Asia, this growth was led by BEVs, which accounted for about 65% of new electric car sales. In Latin America and the Caribbean, sales were more evenly split with PHEVs. Although electric car sales remained low across Africa, they increased by 90%, of which BEVs accounted for 85%.

Less than 20 models were available throughout Africa, and less than 40 in emerging Asian markets. In Latin America and the Caribbean 75 models were available, which are slightly above the number of models in the United States, but far behind Europe and China. Available models tend to be the larger or more expensive ones in emerging markets. Across the countries in the GEF programme, twothirds of the available models were large cars and SUVs in 2021, which is similar to Europe and the United States despite stark disparities in purchasing power. In India, Tata’s Nexon BEV SUV was the bestselling model – accounting for two-thirds of EV sales – and most other offerings were SUVs as well. In South Africa, three-quarters of the available options for electric cars are from high-end brands. Similar observations can be made across the developing and emering economies. For many years, major EV markets such as the China, Europe and United States also have been dominated by high-end models, before car manufacturers could offer less expensive, mass-market options. Even though some small electric vehicle models are now available, prices remain too high for mass-market consumers in emerging market countries. As a result, mostly consumers from high income groups are able to purchase EVs, thereby limiting mass-market adoption. The lack of widely accessible charging infrastructure and weaker regulatory push also contribute to slower market uptake in emerging markets and developing economies.

Consumer spending doubled to reach nearly USD 250 billion, about eight times what was spent five years ago. Government spending, such as through purchase subsidies and tax waivers, also doubled to nearly USD 30 billion. The resulting government share of total spending for electric cars remained at 10%, down from about 20% only five years ago. In China, consumer spending nearly tripled to about USD 90 billion in 2021. Government spending also increased, doubling relative to 2020 levels to reach USD 12 billion.

While government spending to support electric car uptake increased as a whole, the per unit support level remained flat in the range of USD 5 000 - 6 000 over the 2019-2021 period. This reflects two mechanisms that balance each other: increasing per unit subsidies in Covid-related stimulus packages; and tightening eligibility requirements for subsidies with a vehicle price cap (for equity considerations). In the United States, consumer and government spending increased in 2021, although they lag behind levels in China and Europe. Consumer spending doubled to USD 30 billion relative to 2020 levels and government spending tripled to USD 2 billion. Public spending on a per unit basis ranks lower than in other regions, at about USD 3 200, which is above the support level of USD 2 300 provided in 2020, but below the 2019 level of USD 4 500. Electric cars remain cheaper in China The global sales-weighted average price of BEVs in 2021 was just over USD 36 000, down 7% relative to 2020, and stable at USD 51 000 for a PHEV. However, these average prices are significantly skewed downwards by the market in China, which accounts for the highest sales and lowest prices. This is notably due to a stronger market position for small and medium models there, Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 27 Trends and developments in EV markets lower production costs and more integrated domestic battery value chains. Excluding China, the average BEV price was just under USD 50 000 in 2021, up 3% relative to 2020, and over USD 57 000 for the average PHEV, up 4%.

Registration-weighted price distribution for the overall car market and for electric cars, mid-lines being medians. Europe includes: France, Germany and Italy. Sources: IEA analysis based on IHS (2021) and EV Volumes. In China, the sales-weighted average BEV cost about USD 27 000 in 2021, down 6% from the previous year, and USD 40 000 for a PHEV, down 2%. In Europe, the average BEV cost about USD 48 000 in 2021, more expensive than Chinese models but less expensive than US BEVs, and over USD 58 000 for a PHEV, the world’s highest PHEV average price. Both BEV and PHEV average prices were up 4% relative to 2020 average European prices. In the United States, BEVs are more expensive on average although they were cheaper than in 2020 by nearly 4% at over USD 51 000, driven by the dominate Tesla models. Meanwhile, the average PHEV cost about USD 50 000 in 2021, up 3.6% from 2020. There are regional variations in terms of price differential between electric and conventional cars. In China, where electric models are smaller and less expensive on average, the price gap is narrower than in other major markets. We estimate that the sales-weighted median price for BEVs in China was only 9% higher than the overall car market, and that the average BEV was 20% more expensive than the average conventional vehicle, compared to about 45 - 50% in Europe and the United States for both metrics. Globally, decreasing EV prices and increasing driving ranges in 2021 relative to 2020 have resulted in a 10% decrease in the salesweighted average price-per-range ratio for BEVs and 14% for PHEVs. Excluding China, the drop was 7% for BEVs and an increase of 2% for PHEVs because average prices increased faster than the average range. The highest drop for BEVs was recorded in the United States (-8%), where the price dropped by 4% while the range increased by 5% on average.

At a global level, the electric LCV market share is 2%, about four times less than for passenger cars. Even in advanced EV markets, the LCV share barely exceeds 12%. The economic case for electrifying LCVs is stronger than for cars in cases such as urban delivery since LCV fleets are driven intensively, often operate on predictable routes and can be charged at commercial depots. The fact that the uptake of electric LCVs has been slower than cars in most markets to date may be attributable to a mix of factors, including less stringent fuel economy and ZEV regulations, fewer model options, and a diversity of use profiles (including lower annual mileage). China accounted for the largest number of LCVs sales in 2021, at 86 000, showing rapid growth consecutively for 2020 and 2021. Europe was the second-largest market with more than 60 000 electric LCV sales in 2021 and where sales have been quickly increasing partially in response to CO2 performance standards. Korea has seen a very rapid increase in sales of electric LCVs, reaching 28 000 in 2021 (a 12% market share of overall LCVs), up from just 1 500 just two years prior. This increase is attributable to an innovative policy in Korea that incentivises the adoption of EVs for commercial use (see Chapter 2). The vast majority of electric LCVs are BEVs, only a few PHEVs are sold in Europe. This may reflect that most electric LCVs are acquired for specific uses within fixed delivery areas and may not need an extended driving range. The average battery size of LCVs is 18% smaller than for passenger cars; this may be due predictable and shorter routes, or because total ownership and operation costs are key factors in fleet owner decisions to buy electric LCVs.

The very small battery sizes needed to deliver adequate range for a daily commute and the simplicity of their manufacturing make them cheaper to buy than their internal combustion engine (ICE) counterparts in many regions. This is not the case in Europe and the United States where electric models still tend to be more expensive, but where the total costs of ownership and operation are lower than ICE analogues (assuming they are used relatively frequently for transport rather than for recreational purposes). China dominates the market, reaching nearly 9.5 million electric two/three-wheeler new registrations in 2021 out of a global total of just over 10 million.1 Electric two/three-wheeler sales in China increased on average by nearly 25% per year from 2015 to 2021 and now account for more than half the global market. Other high volume markets are Viet Nam where 230 000 electric two/three-wheelers were sold in 2021 and India with nearly 300 000. Electric two/threewheelers can displace the use of oil and cut emissions in these markets where they account for around half of gasoline consumption for all road transport. In Europe, the electric two/three-wheeler market share reached 5% in 2021 with 87 000 sales. 1 Tracking sales of electric two/three-wheelers is not an easy task, as definitions vary across countries.

The initiative welcomed 31 new members in 2021, including the first members headquartered in Brazil and Korea. Over the past year, EV100 members have increased their global ambition, with 5.5 million vehicles now committed across 98 markets worldwide, a 13% increase over previous commitments. Members are acting on these commitments and have collectively deployed over 200 000 EVs and 20 000 charging points at 3 100 locations worldwide. New members that joined in 2021 include Donlen, a US based leasing company, which has committed to more than 150 000 EVs. Zomato, a food delivery service in India, has committed to more than 160 000 EVs. EV100’s first members in Korea, LG Energy Solutions Ltd. and SK Networks, together have committed to transition 200 000 corporate vehicles to electric. Unidas – the first Brazilian EV100 member – is one of the largest car rental companies in the country and aims to electrify 85 000 vehicles by 2027, while also working to install more than 1 000 charging points for staff and customers. The majority of new vans are registered by businesses, which make vehicle purchase decisions based on the total cost of ownership. Recent research shows that in major European markets, electric vans are the cheapest option for all user groups when purchase subsidies are included. This reflects a global trend towards rapidly improving the business case for electric vans. The shift in cost is reflected in demand. Charging infrastructure, electric van driving range and availability of suitable vehicle types all remain barriers to uptake. However, the main challenge is ensuring that supply meets established demand. Number of vehicles and chargers committed by EV100 members, 2017-2021 IEA. All rights reserved.

Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 32 Trends and developments in EV markets Major automakers accelerate electrification plans and aim for a fully electric future In recent years, automakers have been progressively fleshing out business strategies that consider electrification not only as a way to comply with policy regulations or respond to government incentives, but also as an opportunity to capture market share and maintain a competitive edge. Looking forward, one can expect increasingly aggressive pricing and the development of a wider range of models. In some market, the combined ambitions of OEMs are more ambitious than government announcements (see Chapter 3). In 2021, several major automakers have announced plans to accelerate the transition to a fully electric future by developing new product lines as well as converting existing manufacturing capacity. Key examples include: Toyota, the world’s largest car manufacturer, announced the roll-out of 30 BEV models and a goal of reaching 3.5 million annual sales of electric cars by 2030. Lexus aims to achieve 100% BEV sales globally in 2035. Volkswagen announced that all-electric vehicles would exceed 70% of European and 50% of Chinese and US sales by 2030, and that by 2040, nearly 100% should be zero emissions vehicles. Ford expects one-thid of its sales to be fully electric by 2026 and 50% by 2030, building on the success of its F-150 electric model, and to move to all-electric in Europe by 2030. Volvo committed to becoming a fully electric car company by 2030. Geely targets around 30% of electric cars in sales by 2025. BMW aims for 50% of its vehicles sold to be fully electric by 2030 or earlier. Mercedes announced that from 2025, all newly launched vehicles will be fully electric. General Motors aims for 30 EV models and for installed BEV production capacity of 1 million units in North America by 2025 and for carbon neutrality in 2040.

Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 33 Trends and developments in EV markets Korea maintains lead in deploying fuel cell electric vehicles Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) are zero emissions vehicles that convert hydrogen stored on-board using a fuel cell to power an electric motor. Although FCEV cars have been commercially available for about a decade, registrations remain more than two orders of magnitude lower than EVs. This is in part because hydrogen refuelling stations (HRS) are not widely available and unlike EVs, FCEVs cannot be charged at home. In addition, few commercial FCEV models are available, and high fuel costs and purchase prices result in a higher total cost of ownership than EVs. Governments have funded, either fully or partially, the construction of HRSs to enable the deployment of FCEVs, including public buses and municipal trucks as well as cars. Today there are about 730 HRSs globally providing fuel for about 51 600 FCEVs. This represents an increase of almost 50% in the global stock of FCEVs and a 35% increase in the number of HRSs from 2020. Over 80% of the FCEVs on the road at the end of 2021 were LDVs with the majority being passenger cars. Buses and trucks each constitute almost 10% of global FCEV stock. In 2021, Korea maintained the lead in FCEV deployment, with over 19 000 vehicles (almost double the stock at the end of 2020). The United States has the second-largest stock of FCEVs, increasing from about 9 200 at the end of 2020 to 12 400 at the end of 2021. Together, Korea and the United States represent over 60% of global FCEV stock, though only a quarter of refuelling stations with 114 stations in Korea and 67 in the United States. China has the largest fleet of both fuel cell buses and trucks, with a combined stock of more than 8 400 vehicles. China accounts for almost 90% of fuel cell buses worldwide and over 95% of fuel cell trucks. Fuel cell electric vehicle stock, 2021 IEA. All rights reserved.

Bus registrations As in previous years, China dominates the electric bus market and new registrations continue to increase. However, sales of electric buses since about 2018 in the United States and throughout Europe have been chipping away at this dominance of the global market. India is finalising a tender for more than 5 500 electric buses, which should turn it into one of the world’s largest markets for electric buses. The increase in electric bus sales in countries such as France, Germany, Spain and United Kingdom can be attributed to national and/or city-level targets to transition to public procurement of only zero emissions buses, as well as to the EU Clean Vehicles Directive for member states. Heavy-duty truck registrations China accounted for nearly 90% of electric truck registrations in 2021, down from nearly 100% in 2017. Sales in the United States and Europe have begun to rise rapidly in the past few years, driven by an increase in available models in those markets, policy support, rapidly improving technical viability and economic competitiveness of electric trucks in certain applications.

Initial deployment of HDVs in such applications can also build confidence in and familiarity with the faster charging needs and grid capacity which subsequent, HDV duty cycles depend. The first step in EV adoption in the HDV segment will be successful deployment and proof of economic benefits and societal benefits (e.g. reduced noise and air pollution) in early applications. Subsequent roll out will build upon the operational experience, technology advances and infrastructure to deploy zero emissions HDVs in return-to-base operations such as urban delivery vans, shuttle and school buses, and garbage trucks. The aim is to make even longer distance applications with higher overall daily energy storage needs, such as regional and long-haul freight, competitive and convenient, and to increase their payloads as well as their flexibility and autonomy of operations.

Applications with highly variable routes, like urban delivery vans, may also benefit from charging on publicly available chargers in cities, e.g. while drivers take a break. Very fast charging on highways will be needed to provide flexibility and autonomy for regional and long-haul electric trucks. Given the high construction and grid integration costs, the business case for very fast charging infrastructure of more than 350 kilowatts (kW), or even more than 1 megawatt (MW), may be uncertain, especially in the initial years of electric HDV market deployment. This uncertainty coupled with long lead times and investment requirements needed for HDV megawatt charging capacity along transport corridors are announced OEM production model timelines. ZETI data are meant to support fleet operators and policy makers and should not be construed as representative of the entire vehicle market. Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 38 Trends and developments in EV markets challenges (see Chapter 5). Policies and measures to support the development of charging networks, may have an important influence in the timely roll out of charging infrastructure for EVs including HDVs. Strategic planning is required to optimise the design and development to be compatible with HDV operational needs. Co-ordinated roll out will need to focus first on the most heavily used freight corridors. Other options to provide power to electric HDVs are battery swapping and electric road systems. Pilot programmes for battery swapping are underway by various companies in China, e.g. CATL, Foton New Energy Vehicle, Geely, China Energy Investment Corporation and Qiyuan Motive Power. These trials include battery swapping operations for fleets numbering from tens to low hundreds in heavyduty short-distance operations such as urban and regional delivery. A central government direction to pilot battery swapping across eight cities include three that aim to focus on swapping for HDVs and the ambition to scale up the number of trucks using battery swapping into the thousands in the coming few years. By early 2022, 159 new truck models on the Chinese market have battery swapping capabilities. Electric road systems can transfer power to a truck either via inductive coils3 in a road, or through conductive connections between the vehicle and road, or via catenary (overhead) lines. Catenary and other dynamic charging options may be promising from the perspective of competing favourably in terms of total capital and 3 Inductive solutions are further from commercialisation and face challenges to deliver sufficient power to trucks operating at highway speeds. operating costs This is in comparison, with very fast highway charging in which the key determinants of competitiveness are the costs and capacities of batteries for HDVs and the volume of freight traffic. By enabling charging-on-the-move, catenary systems could support operational flexibility of logistics operators. Field trials of catenary systems installed by Siemens with Scania trucks have been used in real transport operations on motorways since 2016. Currently three systems of 13 km length are used by 15 trucks. Germany has announced innovation clusters that aim to roll out hundreds of kilometres of motorway equipped with catenaries, used in combination with stationary charging and refuelling. The United Kingdom aims to trial a catenary system for heavy-duty trucks. A few European countries, e.g. France and the Netherlands, have commissioned studies on the economic viability and environmental impacts of electric road systems. Catenary or other dynamic charging solutions also have the advantage of functioning on any zero emissions powertrain system (i.e. PHEV, BEV or FCEV) equipped with a pantograph or other on-board power transfer components.

Until 2020, the financial performance of EV stocks did not show a significant difference at portfolio level4 with other automakers and was in line with overall market performance. At the close of 2019, the total market capitalisation of the selected 14 EV stocks stood at about 13% that of the top-ten vehicle manufacturers, and the EV index was slightly lower as well. Since 2020, both the EV and battery indices have outpaced that of the top-ten automakers as well as the broader market benchmark. The Covid-19 crisis negatively affected all indices, but the pace of recovery varied. In the first half of 2020, the EV and battery indices recorded robust growth 70% and 40% respectively. This period coincides with announcements of green recovery packages and net zero pledges in major vehicle markets, establishing the EV as a future mode of transport in Europe, Japan and Korea, among other regions. At the close of 2021, the market capitalisation of EV manufacturers was 60% higher than that of the top-ten automakers combined. Such high levels can be primarily attributed to Tesla, which accounts for 80% of the total market capitalisation of 14 pure-play5 EV companies.

The battery index outperformed 4 The financial performance at an equally weighted portfolio level tracks the average financial return on each selected stock regardless of market capitalisation at a given time. that of EVs, reflecting the increasing importance of battery supply chains in major auto markets. The observed decline in returns for the EV index can be attributed to increased competition in passenger vehicle EV markets from traditional automakers. In 2021, the majority of the top-ten automakers expanded their EV businesses, making it more difficult to draw a sharp distinction between the pure-play EV makers and the top-ten automakers.

However, most EV manufacturers lag behind in terms of profitability, with many reporting marginal or negative return on total assets. 5 A pure-play is a company that focusses on one line of business such as an electric vehicle. Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 43 Trends and developments in EV markets The high valuation of stocks could indicate that pure-play EV makers have comparatively easier access to capital from public equity markets. This allows EV companies to expand production and R&D facilities, thus increasing the overall capital expenditure on road transport electrification. On these grounds, high valuations could reflect that investors believe that EV-focussed automakers will capture significant market share, become profitable and provide high financial returns in the future. This implied vision of the future of the automotive sector is in line with a rising number of government plans for the decarbonisation of road transport. One of the key factors underpinning this surge in valuations is that investors are seeking more sustainable and climate-friendly investments. The role of government policy and regulation in providing positive market signals to investors is critical. The EU taxonomy for sustainable activities, introduced in 2020, which includes the manufacturing of EVs and batteries, was an important step to guide investors towards low-carbon industries (see Chapter 2).

However, growth has been much slower in the pandemic period than in previous years. Between 2015 and 2020, the average annual growth rate was over 60%. Europe ranks second with over 300 000 slow chargers in 2021, a 30% year-on-year increase. The Netherlands leads in Europe with more than 80 000 slow chargers, followed by 50 000 in France, 40 000 in Germany, 30 000 in the United Kingdom, 20 000 in Italy and just over 12 000 in both Norway and Sweden. The stock of slow chargers in the United States increased by 12% to 92 000 in 2021, the slowest increase among major markets. In Korea, it increased by nearly 70% to over 90 000. 7 Fast chargers are more than 22 kW and can server LDVs with power ratings of up to 350 kW. Slow chargers are less than or equal to 22 kW. Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 47 Trends and developments in EV markets Public fast charging availability accelerates Publicly accessible fast chargers facilitate longer journeys. As they are increasingly deployed, they will enable longer trips, encourage consumers that lack access to private charging to purchase an EV, and tackle range anxiety as a barrier for EV adoption. Fast charging is being rolled out at a faster pace than slow charging in China, where fast charging installations (power rating >22 kW) increased by over 50% to 470 000 fast chargers in 2021, which is more than the 44% rise in 2020, but slower than the 93% high of 2019. In China, over 40% of publicly available charging units are fast chargers, well above other major EV markets. The drivers behind rapid deployment of public chargers in China are government subsidies and active infrastructure development by public utilities. With regulatory controls on electricity prices, public charging demand coming from urban dwellers as well as increasing electrification of taxis, ride-sharing and logistics fleets have improved the profitability of EV charging businesses. The massive speed and scale of EVSE roll out led to reductions in the costs of manufacturing charger modules for fast charging stations by 67% between 2016 and 2019. In contrast to 2020, when Europe’s fast charging installations significantly outpaced slow charging ones, installations were about the same in 2021. The number of public fast chargers in Europe was up by over 30% to nearly 50 000 units. This includes 9 200 public fast chargers in Germany, 7 700 in the United Kingdom, 6 700 in Norway, 4 500 in France, 2 600 in Spain and in the Netherlands. The United States counts about 22 000 fast chargers, of which nearly 60% are Tesla superchargers. Korea has 15 000 fast chargers, 50% more than in 2020.

Meanwhile, the number of publicly available charging points also tripled to about 1.8 million. Current momentum in EV sales can only be sustained if ever larger shares of the population have access to convenient and affordable charging infrastructure, both publicly available and private chargers at residences and workplaces, among other destinations. Governments will have to continue facilitating investment and minimising barriers to the roll-out of charging infrastructure. As the number of EVs on the road increases, the EV-per-charger ratio can help assess the suitability of the charging network. The charger power (kilowatts [kW]) per EV is an essential metric, since fast chargers can serve a higher number of EVs compared to slow chargers. The suitable number of charger per EV depends on a number of factors, including: housing stock, average distance travelled and population density. PHEV users require less public charging than BEVs. Therefore, it is not trivial to determine a suitable availability metric. For most countries, we observe that as the stock share of BEVs increases, the ratio of charging point per BEVs decreases. Similarly, countries with relatively small EV stocks tend to have low EV to charger ratios as initial infrastructure deployment may precede EV sales. The EV per charging point ratio remained relatively flat over the 20152021 period at under 10 EVs per charging point in China, Korea, and the Netherlands. This reflects charging infrastructure deployment that matches the speed of EV stock growth. In the United States, the number of EVs on roads outpaced the number of public charging points, with about 18 EVs per charging point in 2021. A similar trend is observed in Norway, where there were only a handful of EVs per charging unit in the early 2010s versus around 29 by 2021. Both the markets in Norway and United States are characterised by widespread reliance on home charging, due to the high share of single family dwellings (with garages) by international standards. It appears that in countries that rely more heavily on public charging, the charging network is expanding accordingly, while for countries with high shares of residential charging, fewer public chargers can serve a higher number of EVs. As the market evolves and more consumers replace conventional vehicles with EVs, even in countries with high shares of single family dwellings, the reliance on public charging solutions will increase. Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 50 Trends and developments in EV markets Many European countries still fall short of AFID recommendations In the European Union, the 2014 Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Directive (AFID) regulates the deployment of public electric vehicle supply equipment. The policy recommended that EU member states reach 10 electric light-duty vehicles (LDVs) per public charger by 2020. Proposed new EU legislation (the Alternative Fuelling Infrastructure Regulation [AFIR]) would mandate 1 kW of publicly available charger per BEV and 0.66 kW per PHEV as well as the minimum public charger coverage on highways (see Chapter 2). In 2021, the European Union’s average EV to charger ratio was 14, up from nearly 11 in 2020 and above the recommendation of 10. The average kW per EV ratio was just above 1 kW, which is the level proposed in the AFIR for 2030. Some countries have performed better than others in meeting targets, such as the Netherlands (5 and 2.6 kW per EV ratio) which followed a wide, on demand, slow charger deployment strategy. In fact, the share of fast chargers remains generally low at around 3% in the Netherlands. Italy roughly meets the recommended charger ratios (11 EVs per charger), mostly due to slow charger availability. In Norway, the ratio is 34 EVs per charger and 0.7 kW per EV in 2021, but fast chargers account for nearly 35%. There are promising prospects in Spain, which had 20 EVs per charger and 1.2 kW per EV and over 30% of fast charging in 2021, with an EV fleet now larger than Denmark’s. The largest markets in Europe – France, Germany and United Kingdom – all do not meet the European Union’s recommended charger availability recommendations. The worldwide average in 2021 was 10 EVs per charger and 2.4 kW per EV. China’s market is pulling the global averages downwards with 7 EVs per charger and 3.8 kW per EV, along with 40% of fast charging.

Of these, 93% are publicly accessible, and 17% are on non-urban roads (including highways and other arterials). A disproportionate share of direct current (DC) fast chargers are public (99%) and located on highways (25%), reflecting the faster charging needs at these locations. About 6% of charging stations are located along the interstate highway system, the backbone of the national road network. Stations along the interstate highways account for 16% of the total number of DC fast charging points. About 8% of the US population lives more than 10 km from a public charging station.

China, the leading EV market, progressively decreased subsidies for new energy vehicles (NEV) 12 as sales reached 16% in 2021 – more than tripling from 5% in 2020. China recently announced an ambition to develop sufficient charging infrastructure to meet the needs of 20 million NEVs by 2025. It also set guidelines to strengthen the management of its rapidly expanding lithium-ion battery industry, including minimum production requirements prior to expanding capacity, minimum technical battery performance standards, plant operating conditions and land development requirements. In the United States, also a key EV market, the federal government announced its first targets that include 50% EV sales by 2030 and 500 000 public chargers. The targets are underpinned by existing incentives, and new funding packages of USD 7.5 billion to build charging infrastructure and USD 3 billion for advanced battery supply chains in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. 11 Targets are official government declarations set out in legislation, budgetary commitments, Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement or national climate plans such as those submitted by member states to the European Union. 12 NEVs (China) include BEVs, PHEVs and fuel cell electric vehicles. Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 56 Policies for EV deployment In the last year, Canada pushed forward the federal government’s target for achieving 100% zero emissions LDV sales to 2035 from 2040. Leading provinces (such as British Colombia and Quebec) scaled up their policy ambitions in response. The Fit-for-55 package in the European Union brought forward a host of policy and stimulus measures to accelerate ZEV transitions. These include a proposal for 100% ZEVs by 2035 through its CO2 emissions standard and new mandated charging infrastructure deployment targets set under the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation proposal for both light-duty vehicles (LDVs) and heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs). In 2021, Japan put forward a large funding package for EV purchase subsidies and charging following the doubling of its BEV purchase subsidies the previous year. Korea has almost tripled eligible funding compared to last year for slow chargers as well as extending its subsidies for EVs until 2025. India, in 2021, extended its main EV demand stimulating FAME II policy to 2024. It also increased subsidies for electric two-wheelers and made budgetary commitments for battery swapping policies and the development of EV manufacturing and battery supply capacity. Thailand and Indonesia aim to become leaders in EV markets in the region and to supply growing demand in other Asian countries. In 2021, Thailand, a new entrant in EV markets, announced ambitions of 30% of domestic vehicle production to be ZEVs by 2030 and 100% of new vehicle registrations to be ZEVs by 2035. It also announced a package of incentives to promote EV deployment. Indonesia recently created a government-owned battery corporation that aims to build 140 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of battery capacity by 2030, of which 50 GWh will be for export. (Today’s global battery manufacturing production capacity is about 871 GWh). In Latin America, Chile is an EV market leader. Its capital city, Santiago, boasts one of the largest electric urban bus fleets outside of China. Chile recently announced its National Electromobility Strategy, which sets enhanced ambitions to have 100% ZEVs in LDV sales by 2030 and 100% in public transport vehicles by 2035, as well as for long-distance trucks by 2045.

Ambitious government policy announcements, strategies and budgetary commitments also characterised EV developments in 2021. Government expenditure on subsidies for electric cars doubled in 2021 through a variety of policies to foster market uptake Strong policy measures to boost nascent EV industries have been used over the years in some markets, e.g. China and European Union. Now some markets, such as China, Korea and United Kingdom, are steadily reducing per vehicle direct subsidies in recognition of the ongoing closing of the gap between the purchase price of electric and conventional cars, and to push auto manufacturers to lower costs. Others, such as the EU, are using regulatory measures such as tighter CO2 emissions standards. The European Union, India and Japan are increasing subsidies for EVs, in some cases as part of post-COVID19 recovery packages. In 2021, government expenditure on electric car subsidies almost doubledalmost doubled (see Chapter 1). Governments announced more ambitious ZEV targets and policies in 2021 than ever before Following the pathfinders for ZEV deployment, the number of countries that have announced some form of ZEV or electrification target increased significantly. Some employ a CO2 target which, in effect, would ban ICE cars by requiring zero tailpipe emissions, i.e., European Union. It has become increasingly clear that a growing number of countries have incorporated the electrification of cars and trucks as a key part of their strategy to reduce emissions as outlined in Nationally Determined Contributions or net zero targets. Strategic direction and incentives provided by national and state governments can provide pivotal signals to shift investment to secure EV supply chains and for original equipment manufacturers to develop a wide variety of affordable ZEV car and truck models as manufacturing companies seek to meet stricter regulatory requirements and net zero commitments.

Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 61 Policies for EV deployment Highlights of recent electric LDV policies in selected countries Canada • Share of global LDV sales in 2021: 2.0% • Electric LDV market share in 2021: 5.5% • Electric LDV year-over-year (YOY) increase: 71% Canada’s Emissions Reduction Plan (ERP) 2030 contains key milestones that aim to meet its legally binding net zero by 2050 target. This includes a push to 2035 from the previous 2040 to achieve the 100% zero emissions LDV sales target, with interim targets of 20% ZEV sales by 2026 and 60% by 2030. The ERP aims to turn this target into a legally binding ZEV sales mandate. In March 2022, CAD 1.7 billion (USD 1.3 billion) was announced for incentives for ZEVs as part of the ERP. To date, the federal government has invested more than CAD 1 billion (USD 769 million) to support ZEV deployment via infrastructure and purchase subsidies. In April 2022, the government increased its maximum vehicle price to allow for large ZEV cars such as SUVs, minivans and pick-up trucks, to be eligible for subsidies. Previously at a flat maximum vehicle price of CAD 55 000 (USD 42 308), large ZEV cars, with a vehicle price of up to CAD 60 000 – 70 000 (USD 46 154 – 53 846), would be eligible to receive subsidies. With increasing sales of SUVs occurring all over the world, higher sales of less efficient, electric SUVs rather than small electric cars would increase electricity demand for charging vehicles and also the demand for raw materials such as lithium, nickel and cobalt for batteries. Leading provinces also continue to push ZEV deployment. For example, in British Columbia where ZEVs hold an 8% market share (2020), the provincial government aims to accelerate its ZEV mandate to 100% zero emissions LDV sales by 2035 (from 2040). Quebec maintains a target to reach 100% zero emissions LDV sales by 2035, and aims to increase the stringency of its ZEV standard. Nova Scotia introduced a subsidy scheme in 2021 for ZEVs, along with Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland and Labrador. Chile • Share of global LDV sales in 2021: 0.4% • Electric LDV market share in 2021: 0.2% • Electric LDV YOY increase: 263% In October 2021, Chile announced new ambitions to have 100% zero emissions LDV sales by 2035 complementing the existing ambition Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 62 Policies for EV deployment of 40% ZEV stock by 2050. An initiative to promote the use of EVs for urban logistics within the Santiago Metropolitan Area was developed. Companies would be allowed to demonstrate pilot projects, with access to free charging and the use of a commercial LDV for eight weeks. China • Share of global LDV sales in 2021: 26.7% • Electric LDV market share in 2021: 15.4% • Electric LDV YOY increase: 183% China extended its NEV subsidy scheme to the end of 2022, an extension from the previous expiry date of 2020, with a reduction in the base subsidy amount of 10%, 20% and 30% each year between 2020 and 2022. The range of purchase subsidies has steadily decreased over time. The intention is to gradually ratchet up standards on domestic technology innovation and promote the manufacturing and adoption of EV models that must meet increasingly stringent performance and efficiency targets to receive the subsidy, with a view to develop EVs for the export market.

(BEVs) over time, with the effect that the average range of BEVs sold has increased by 50% since 2016. Despite decreasing subsidies, EV sales in China have continued to increase, particularly in 2021. The sharp increase in sales may in part reflect a rush by consumers to qualify for subsidies before the end of the NEV subsidy programme, generating increased demand as well as other market-based reasons (see Chapter 1). The 20% NEV by 2025 target was established in the Development Plan for the NEV Industry (2021-2035).

A binding intermediate target aims to cut emissions by at least 55% by 2030 (relative to 1990 levels). The “Fit-for-55” package was launched in July 2021 and contains key proposals to meet the intermediate target for 2030. The Fit-for-55 package includes a proposal by the European Commission to have more ambitious CO2 emissions standards (compared to current legislation). It would require fleet emissions reductions (from a 2021 starting point) of 55% for cars and 50% for vans by 2030, and 100% for both by 2035. This would effectively ban the sales of ICE vehicles from 2035, as it essentially mandates that all vehicles sold from that year produce zero tailpipe emissions (it excludes plug-in hybrids, which emit CO2 from the tailpipe). The proposal is currently sitting within the European Parliament awaiting approval, with negotiations ongoing. There has also been significant policy progress among some EU member states, for instance including EV-related measures in sustainable recovery components of Covid-19 economic stimulus packages. As part of a large recovery package announced in June 2020, Germany allocated funding for EV charging infrastructure deployment and battery development. Consequently electric car sales increased dramatically. It also increased government EV purchase/lease subsidies (now extended to the end of 2022) up to a maximum of EUR 9 000 (USD 10 647) (which includes EUR 6 000 (USD 7 098) from the government and EUR 3 000 (USD 3 549) from the manufacturer). The government’s portion of the subsidy will decrease over time until 2025 - EUR 4 000 (USD 4 732) in 2023 and EUR 3 000 (USD 3 549) in 2024. Subsidies for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are likely to be scrapped at the end of 2022. Germany also offers beneficial tax rates such as benefit-in-kind of 0.25% for BEVs. In Spain, pandemic-related recovery funding of EUR 400 million (USD 473 million) is being directed to EV incentive programmes as part of MOVES III. Subsidies for ZEV purchases in Spain are maximised at EUR 9 000 (USD 10 647) (with scrapping). France experienced a significant increase in electric LDV sales in 2021, likely due to its ecological bonus programme which provides subsidies for ZEV purchases under its Covid-19 economic package, France Relance, which was extended to mid-2022 (although the subsidy level decreased from a maximum of EUR 7 000 to EUR 6 000 (USD 8 281 to USD 7 098) in mid-2021.

Yet, India has been showing increasing promise with recent policy developments, such as the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid and) Electric Vehicles II (FAME II) scheme which was extended by the government from 2022 to the end of March 2024. The scheme was revised to include a 50% increase in purchase incentives for electric two-wheelers to Indian rupees (INR) 15 000 (USD 203) per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of battery capacity. Additionally, the limit on this incentive was relaxed from covering up to 20% of the purchase cost of a two-wheeler to 40%. The Ministry of Heavy Industries contracted with state-owned Energy Efficiency Services Limited to procure 300 000 electric threewheelers to spur government-led demand aggregation following the FAME II extension. India had a little more than 1 million EVs on the road at the end of 2021, most of which were electric two/three-wheelers that account for less than 0.5% of all vehicles. FAME II is about halfway through its expected programme life, yet has funded only around 10% of its target sales volumes. The recent FAME II modification may help address barriers to uptake by reducing upfront purchase cost and sparking innovation to provide broader EV model availability. The electrification of two-wheelers in India is seen as an opportunity to cost effectively electrify at scale, as it is the largest two-wheeler market in the world. Nineteen states in India offer some form of policy support for EVs, such as purchase incentives, exemptions from road taxes, and subsidies for investment in battery manufacturing and related components. The states of Assam, Goa and Maharashtra recently introduced EV targets, policies and incentives. New Delhi, the capital, hosts the most ambitious EV targets in the country.

In 2022, subsidies were limited to cars priced less than KRW 55 million (USD 48 077), and only cars priced below KRW 85 million (USD 74 300) were eligible for 50% of the subsidy amount. Lower cost EV car models benefitted from these changes. In a context where overall government funding increased but maximum per car subsidies marginally decreased between 2020 – 2021 and more markedly decreased by 33% in 2021-2022 , the sales shares of these lower cost models increased markedly. Korea also extended its subsidy scheme until 2025 and the number of eligible vehicles for subsidies in hopes to meet its vehicle electrification targets. Per vehicle subsidies in 2021 and 2022 were substantially higher for light commercial vehicles (LCVs). Electric LCV models face fewer hurdles to obtain commercial registration permits than ICE LCVs, which resulted in dramatic growth in electric LCV sales over 2020 Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 68 Policies for EV deployment volumes. Depending on the model, LCVs can receive between KRW 9 million and 27 million (USD 7 867 and 23 601) in 2022. Total government funding for electric LCV subsidies increased from KRW 210 billion (USD 184 million) in 2020, to KRW 400 billion (USD 349 million) in 2021 and KRW 574 billion (USD 502 million) in 2022. United Kingdom • Share of global LDV sales in 2021: 2.4% • Electric LDV market share in 2021: 16.3% • Electric LDV YOY increase: 80% In mid-December 2021, EV car subsidies in the United Kingdom for ZEV cars decreased from GBP 2 500 to GBP 1 500 (USD 3 571 to USD 2 143), with the upper price limit falling from GBP 35 000 to GBP 32 000 (USD 50 000 to USD 45 714). Subsidies for small and large vans (emitting less than 50 grammes per kilometre (g/km) and capable of travelling 96 km with zero emissions), decreased from GBP 3 000 to GBP 2 500 (USD 4 286 to USD 3 571) for small vans and from GBP 6 000 to GBP 5 000 (USD 8 571 to USD 7 143) for large vans This came at a time when the government launched consultations in early 2022 to implement a ZEV mandate beginning in 2024 as part of its Net Zero Strategy. Tax incentives continue to be available for employee purchase or lease of ZEV company cars by setting the tax rate for BEVs from 1% in 2021/22 and 2% in 2022/23 through to 2024/25 (2021-2023, 20% for ICE vehicle equivalent). United States • Share of global LDV sales in 2021: 17.8% • Electric LDV market share in 2021: 4.2% • Electric LDV YOY increase: 114% Electric car sales in the United States more than doubled in 2021 relative to 2020. Significant policy changes in 2021 focussed on building technological leadership and boosting domestic EV industries. An executive order issued in August 2021 set a new ambition for EVs to represent 50% of light-duty vehicle sales in 2030 – the first EV target announced at the federal level. An executive order rescinded the less ambitious Safer, Affordable Fuel-Efficient Act (SAFE) and proposed more ambitious fuel economy targets that aligned with new ZEV and net zero ambitions. Finalised rulings established more stringent standards for both corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for model years 2024-2026 (CAFE) and 2023-2026 (GHG emissions). The stricter emissions standards and reduced compliance flexibility reflect the current administration’s focus on accelerating ZEV adoption to foster GHG emissions reductions and a competitive domestic EV industry. The new GHG emissions Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 69 Policies for EV deployment standards require between 5-10% emissions reductions each year, and thus require more rapid improvement than even the 2012 standards, albeit from a high fuel consumption baseline. The new CAFE standards will require fuel efficiency improvements of 8-10% between 2024-2026.

The bill is pending. It proposes to augment the federal tax incentive for the purchase of an EV to USD 12 000. This would be a restructuring of the USD 7 500 base incentive, plus an additional USD 4 500 for EVs equipped with batteries manufactured and produced with union labour in the United States. Notably, the state of California has been allowed to reinstate its ZEV mandate rather than be subject to less ambitious federal standards. For decades, California had followed its own state level regulations through a waiver. This capability was rescinded in 2019 in favour of the SAFE ruling. Nine other states have adopted California’s ZEV mandate. A California state government executive order in 2021 bans new ICE passenger vehicle sales by 2035. Similarly, the governor of New York signed legislation in 2021 for in-state sales of new LDVs to be 100% zero emission by 2035. The state of Washington has passed legislation (awaiting governor approval) to require 100% EV sales by 2030. The state of California, which accounted for 11% of new LDV sales in the United States in 2021, proposed USD 6.1 billion for EV-related initiatives in January 2022 – the largest ever budget commitment for EVs at the state level. Of this amount, USD 1.2 billion will directly support the addition of 40 000 new passenger EVs. The initiative focuses on tax credits, charging infrastructure and vehicle subsidies. Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 70 Policies for EV deployment EU Taxonomy Regulation helps define sustainable investment paths The Taxonomy Regulation in the European Union provides a science-based classification system that defines various economic activities that can be qualified as environmentally sustainable, including investments related to electromobility. Companies are not obligated to align their economic activities with the Taxonomy Regulation. However, certain companies will be obligated to disclose their share of activities that align with the Taxonomy Regulation (via the Disclosures Delegated Act under Article 8 that came into force in January 2022). The classification system enables more reliable public information for investors and stakeholders, and a more transparent and science-based comparison of investment options considered environmentally sustainable. It also helps companies more objectively plan and raise financing for sustainable economic activities. A supplement to the Taxonomy Regulation is the Climate Delegated Act, which came into force in January 2022. It establishes technical screening criteria for economic activities, that make a substantial contribution and do no significant harm to the environment. Sustainable economic activities pertaining to electromobility state that cars with up to 50 g CO2/km of tailpipe emissions (or ZEVs, inlcuding PHEVs) count as a sustainable activity until 2025. After 2025, only zero g CO2/km tailpipe emission cars qualify as sustainable. Other electromobility-related activities include infrastructure dedicated to the operation of ZEVs, such as electric charging points, electricity grid connection upgrades, hydrogen refuelling stations and electric road systems. Energy vectors used for road transport vehicles are included such as electricity and hydrogen if they follow emissions and sustainability criteria (less than 100 g CO2-eq/kWh). The taxonomy has also been significant in pandemic-related recovery packages to steer financial flows to sustainable and physical activities such as offering taxonomy regulation compliant green bonds and infrastructure. At least 37% of the EU’s Recovery and Resilience Fund is to be climate aligned and 30% of the Next Generation EU funds are to be raised through green bonds. The European Union is also integrating elements of the Taxonomy Regulation into the Recovery and Resilience Fund. Other countries are following suit. Korea has stated it will develop a taxonomy for green finance to achieve its net zero emissions commitments. Similarly, Japan has stated it will work with financial institutions to develop criteria for sustainable investment. An Executive Order on Climate-Related Financial Risk by the US government looks to support efforts in climate-aligned investment.

With decreasing costs and improvements in battery performance, the potential to electrify certain operations and vehicle types above 3.5 tonnes of gross vehicle weight is paired with a realisation of the transformative impact of electrifying these operations to achieve global climate goals. Although initiatives to roll out zero emissions HDVs at scale are generally aimed toward 2025 or later, these ambitions coupled with wider model availability have begun to set up the necessary regulatory climate to accelerate the electrification of HDVs. In 2021, 15 countries14 (representing roughly 5% of global mediumduty and heavy-duty vehicle [M/HDV] sales) announced support for the Global Drive to Zero campaign and programme. These countries demonstrated their support by committing to the first global Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Zero Emissions Medium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicles. Signatories intend to work together to achieve 2030 and 2040 targets for ZEV new truck and bus sales. Progress towards these goals will be reported annually and signatories are to develop plans to support such ambitions. Thirtynine companies, subnational governments and other key stakeholders also endorsed the MoU, signalling additional industry support for these ZEV targets. Highlights of recent electric M/HDV policies Canada In March 2022, the ERP created zero emissions targets for the first time for M/HDVs: 35% ZEV sales by 2030. The government aims to create a M/HDV ZEV sales regulation requiring 100% ZEV sales by 2040, with interim mid-2020 and 2030 regulated sales requirements that vary based on vehicle category. Measures to support this target include CAD 547.5 million (USD 421 million) for a M/HDV purchase incentive programme, CAD 33.8 million (USD 26 million) for hydrogen trucking demonstration projects, and a tax write-off for business investments in heavy-duty ZEVs starting at a rate of 100% from 2020 to 2023 and decreasing thereafter. Canada also established a CAD 2.75 billion (USD 2.12 billion) Zero Emissions Transit Fund to help communities invest in zero emissions public transit and school buses, with a commitment to purchase 5 000 zero emissions buses over the next five years. Subsidies for M/HDV ZEV deployment are provided in British Columbia and Quebec. 14 Supporting countries :Austria, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom, Uruguay and Wales. Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 73 Policies for EV deployment Global Commercial Vehicle Drive to Zero Program The Global Commercial Vehicle Drive to Zero Program is a multistakeholder partnership program of over 130 government and industry leaders focussed on accelerating the deployment of zero emissions M/HDVs. Launched in 2018, Drive to Zero’s vision is that zero emissions M/HDVs will be commercially viable in first success applications and early-mover regions by 2025, and will dominate new vehicle sales by 2040. Drive to Zero is a campaign of the Clean Energy Ministerial under the Electric Vehicles Initiative, coordinated by CALSTART. It recognises the disproportionate impact that the largest vehicles on the road have on fuel consumption, GHG emissions and air pollution. During COP26, Drive to Zero, working in collaboration with the government of the Netherlands, launched a Global Memorandum of Understanding on Zero Emissions Medium- and Heavy-duty Vehicles among 15 countries and endorsed by subnational governments and industry leaders. The Global MoU includes a target of 100% of new truck and bus sales being zero emissions by 2040 and an interim target of 30% by 2030. Drive to Zero’s efforts are focussed on implementation and ensuring that the signatories and endorsers have the resources to make informed decisions that accelerate zero emissions M/HDV sales and deployment. The Drive to Zero programme manages a number of industry leading tools including the Zero-Emission Technology Inventory (ZETI), a Total Cost of Ownership calculator (TCO) and most recently the Global MOU Progress Tracker Dashboard. Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 74 Policies for EV deployment Chile Among goals announced in the release of the National Electromobility Strategy in January 2022, Chile set a target for 100% of public transport vehicles (buses, taxis and shared taxis) sold to be zero emissions by 2035, and by 2045 for freight transport (longdistance trucks) and intercity buses. Santiago, the capital, is already home to one of the largest electric urban bus fleets, outside of China.

With more than 800 electric buses (including mini buses) on the road, new procurements by municipal governments for electric buses (now awaiting delivery) will add almost 1 000 buses to its fleet. Various partnerships have made this possible including the electric mobility project launched through a collaboration between Enel X, BYD Chile, and the public transport operator in Chile, Metbus, where 483 electric buses are to be supplied by more than 120 charging points in terminals. China In China, VI-a emissions standards for new urban HDVs took effect in 2020, followed by standards for remaining HDVs in July 2021. In July 2023, China will introduce VI-b emissions standards that establish more stringent testing requirements and monitoring systems. Some sources state a new set of regulations requiring the sale of zero emissions new energy commercial vehicles may be under development in China, where it is expected that the policy will likely mirror the NEV mandate for LDVs. In addition to purchase incentives outlined in late 2020 for medium- and heavy-duty ZEVs, a four-year pilot programme was announced whereby select cities are to receive support for R&D and demonstration of fuel cell electric vehicles. In 2021, Beijing-TianjinHebei, Shanghai and Guangdong provinces were approved as the first demonstration cities. The release of the 14th FYP for Green Transportation by the Ministry of Transport sets an ambition for NEVs to account for 72% of national urban public transport (including LDVs and buses) and 20% of logistics distribution by 2025. Regional policies for Shanghai, Ningxia and Guangdong have set targets for 96%, 45% and 100%, respectively, for all new buses to be NEVs by 2025. European Union As a part of the European Green Deal, the CO2 emissions performance standard for HDVs will be reviewed in the fourth-quarter of 2022. Currently, the regulation requires reducing specific CO2 emissions of regulated segments of medium- and heavy-duty trucks by 15% by 2025 and 30% by 2030, on average, relative to their 2019-2020 level. The proposed revision of the regulation extends its scope to other vehicle categories (such as buses) and also includes targets for 2035 and 2040. Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 75 Policies for EV deployment The Clean Vehicles Directive was to be transposed into national laws by August 2021.The directive sets national targets for the public procurement of “clean vehicles”15 for HDVs. In February 2022, the European Parliament approved a proposal for a directive amending the Eurovignette Directive. The amendments would benefit ZEV HDV operators, who would receive significant toll discounts and no longer face time-based toll charges, but distance-based charges instead (in most cases). EU member states that are leading in the zero emissions HDV market, such as the Netherlands, have set ambitious targets for trucks, public buses and zero emissions zones.16 To assist companies in this transition, the government has announced a Zero Emissions Trucks Purchase Grant (AanZET), offering a range of subsidies (beginning May 2022) for large, medium and small enterprises. Other examples include Finland, where in addition to declaring HDV targets, an initiative was launched in 2021 to draft a law to provide purchase subsidies for heavyduty ZEVs (starting in 2022). In Sweden, a budget of SEK 120 million per year (USD 13.9 million) (until 2023) provides subsidies for public transport agencies and companies, municipalities and eligible companies that purchase electric buses and alternative fuel HDVs. 15 A clean heavy-duty vehicle is defined as any truck or bus using alternative fuels, including hydrogen, battery electric, plug-in hybrid, natural gas (compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas and biomethane), liquid biofuels, synthetic and paraffinic fuels, and liquefied petroleum gas. Austria’s 2021 Mobility Master Plan outlines targets to end the sale of conventional M/HDVs under 18 tonnes by 2030, and by 2035 for those over 18 tonnes. A total of EUR 46 million (USD 54 million) was available in to support electromobility, including EUR 60 000 (USD 70 980) offered for the purchase of eligible commercial heavy-duty ZEVs and up to EUR 130 000 (USD 153 790) for buses. EUR 46 million (USD 54 million) was available in 2021 to support electromobility, including EUR 60 000 (USD 70 980) for the purchase of eligible commercial heavy-duty ZEVs and up to EUR 130 000 for buses (USD 153 790).

India State-owned Convergence Energy Services Limited aims to procure more than 5 500 electric buses as a part of its Grand Challenge Initiative. The initiative has been launched in five major cities across India, with a goal of expanding to nine cities. The initiative aims to aggregate demand, facilitate procurement and standardise the process across major cities. The tender is planned to be between INR 35 – 55 billion (USD 475 million-USD 744 million), pulling funding 16 As of July 2021, numerous cities (primarily in Europe) have implemented zero emissions zones or have announced plans to do so . Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 76 Policies for EV deployment from the FAME II scheme, acting as one of the largest tenders of this kind in the world. The date of bus deployment has not been publicised. Norway Norway has a target of 100% of new HDVs, 75% of new long-distance buses and 50% of new trucks sold to be zero emissions by 2030. These targets are supported by a subsidy scheme and a fuel tax imposed on HDVs of approximately EUR 200 (USD 237) per tonne of CO2. United Kingdom The National Bus Strategy for England was published in March 2021, setting out how it will improve co-ordination in bus service and integrate with other modes of travel as part of a decarbonisation roadmap. This is in addition to a commitment (made in November 2020) to deliver 4 000 zero emissions buses by 2025. Funding of GBP 200 million (USD 286 million) was announced in March 2022 to keep this pledge on track. The country has committed to investing GBP 270 million (USD 386 million) to zero emissions buses through the ZEBRA scheme launched in 2021, in addition to the GBP 50 million (USD 71 million) through the All-Electric Bus Town or City Scheme. In addition, the United Kingdom aims to phase out the sale of new small petrol and diesel trucks by 2035, and large trucks (>26 tonnes) by 2040. The government began consultations in March 2022 related to new non-zero emissions buses, coaches and minibuses that aims to set a realistic date to end the sale of these vehicles. To support fleet operators, the Department for Transport announced a GBP 20 million fund (USD 29 million) to support pilot projects. For eligible vehicles, a Plug-in Truck Grant offers a purchase subsidy of GBP 16 000 - GBP 25 000 (USD 22 857 - USD 35 714) In its most populated city, London, government has announced that all new public transport buses will be zero emissions by 2034. United States California’s Advanced Clean Truck Regulation obliges minimum ZEV sales targets. In 2021 the states of New York, Washington, Oregon, New Jersey and Massachusetts followed suit. In April 2021 several of these state governments facilitated a request to set federal standards and programmes for 100% ZEVs in new sales of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles by 2045 or earlier. A recently released California Blueprint earmarks USD 6.1 billion toward ZEV initiatives in the state, including support for the electrification of heavy-duty trucks. In December 2021, the California Air Resources Board adopted a new regulation that updates standards, testing and compliance regarding HDV emissions of nitrogen oxide (NOx) and particulate matter for model years (MY) 2024 to 2031. Shortly thereafter, the US Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to commence the Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 77 Policies for EV deployment establishment of new standards for criteria pollutants (NOx) for heavy trucks (starting with MY 2027) to be finalised in 2022. The proposal, released in March 2022, would reduce NOx emissions by between 47- 61% by 2045. This will be followed by an update to current GHG standards to allow for ZEV powertrains starting as soon as MY 2030. Other proposed updates include a more stringent GHG standard for MY 2027 (1.5% more stringent than the original 2016 standard for vocational vehicles17 and day-cab tractor-trailer trucks18), stricter GHG standards for MY 2028 and 2029, and a revision to the advanced vehicle credit multiplier between MY 2023 – MY 2028 (to provide fewer credits for ZEVs"}

The US federal administration announced funding of USD 7.5 billion toward the electrification of thousands of school and transit buses across the country. Additionally, USD 1.1 billion in grants have been made available for modernising transit bus fleets as part of the Low or No Emissions Program. A total of USD 5.5 billion will be allocated to the programme over five years, a portion of which would go towards ZEVs. 17 This includes Class 2b to 8 vehicles, defined as all HDVs that are not included in the heavy-duty pickup truck and van or the Class 7 and 8 tractor categories. Some examples include: service vehicles for urban delivery, refuse hauling, utility service, dump trucks, concrete mixing trucks, transit service, shuttle service, school buses, emergency vehicles and tow trucks. 18 Tractor configurations can vary. Day-cab tractors are typically used for short-haul operations, while sleeper cab tractor-trailer trucks are used for long-haul operations.

Their charging networks supplied the largest percentages – 48% in China and 33% in Europe of global EV stock in 2021. This should come as no surprise, as the deployment of charging infrastructure is critical to enabling ZEV adoption. Both China and Europe are looking to enhance charging infrastructure to meet escalating consumer demand in areas such as standardisation, improved charge point performance, broader locational coverage to include rural areas, customer service and increased flexibility for installing technological advances like high power chargers. Strategies for the long term focus on building smart and well connected EV charging networkst. Announcements of ZEV deployment pledges were significant in 2021. A focus to deploy adequate publicly accessible charging infrastructure needs to go hand-in-hand to realise ZEV ambitions. Keeping pace with ambitious EV deployment requires significant investment in charging infrastructure. More mature EV markets need to not only further expand the quantity of charging stations to meet growing demand but also to ensure that a well connected network is developed to provide EV charging access in developed and rural areas, residences and key transport corridors. In emerging market and developing economies, additional barriers may include electricity access and stable grid connections. Overall, decarbonisation of electricity systems is a critical factor to achieve the full emissions reduction potential of ZEVs. Lessons learned from major ZEV markets demonstrate that the lack of strategic infrastructure development either by central government planning or incentivised by policy mechanisms, along with insufficient co-ordination across key players, e.g. various government entities, utilities, building operators and charge point providers, tends to lead to infrastructure concentrated in certain areas (often lacking in remote regions).

Data on mobility patterns can help to understand charging patterns and behaviours in order to optimise EV network planning. Other work is needed to deploy smart grid technologies, maximise the use of renewables for charging, incentivise and streamline charging infrastructure integration, and provide incentives to energy market participants to stimulate advances in related technologies. Gaps in where charging points are built because they may not be the Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 81 Policies for EV deployment best business case do not always align with an evenly distributed charging network. Government measures to address this include: to prioritise EV charging infrastructure deployment in policy to attract investment; provide long-term contracts for electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE); and bundle various location types in competitive EVSE procurements. Highlights of recent EV charging policies in selected countries Canada Number of electric LDVs per public charging point: 2019 Number of public charging points per thousand LDV stock20: 0.53 Canada’s Electric Vehicle and Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Deployment Initiative provided CAD 96.6 million (USD 74 million) toward building a coast-to-coast network of fast charging stations, and has now ended. The Zero Emissions Vehicle Infrastructure is a five-year programme to 2027 with CAD 680 million (USD 523 million) to address charging infrastructure gaps, for example at workplaces and multi-unit residential buildings. A target of 50 000 new EV chargers and hydrogen stations to be added to the charging network 19 Measures the ratio between total EV stock (2021) to total public charging points. A low ratio can be indicative of a high number of charging points, but also a low EV stock. This metric aims to provide a comparative analysis between countries on the state of charging infrastructure deployment. was announced in late 2021. Subsequently, in March 2022, the ERP announced an additional CAD 500 million (USD 384 million) for ZEV charging stations and refuelling infrastructure from the Canada Infrastructure Bank. Some provinces that lead in EV market share are allocating public funds to subsidise charging infrastructure development. In British Columbia, the CleanBC Roadmap to 2030 set a target of 10 000 public charging stations by 2030 and allocated CAD 1 million (USD 769 000) to assist public sector organisations to access rebates for the purchase and installation of level 2 chargers. Quebec’s Strategy to Electrify Transport 2021-2023 aims to increase the number of charging stations and creates reserved parking spots exclusively for EVs. Nova Scotia recently announced funding of CAD 500 000 (USD 384 615) for EV charging deployment. Ontario has announced a budget of CAD 91 million (USD 70 million) to install EV chargers at highway rest stops, recreational areas and carpool parking lots. China Number of electric LDVs per public charging point: 7 Number of public charging points per thousand LDV stock: 4 20 This metric uses 2021 LDV stock and is used to provide a comparison between countries of public charging point development irrespective of current EV deployment. Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 82 Policies for EV deployment China has the largest EV charging infrastructure network in the world, with more than 1.1 million public charging points, which is 40% more than the previous year. As part of China’s electrification ambitions, ten ministries and commissions published guidance for enhancing EV charging infrastructure services in January 2022. It calls for charging infrastructure to meet the needs of more than 20 million EVs and 60-80% of expressway services (depending on the area) to have fast charging stations by 2025. An emphasis on building a well connected and distributed EV charging network, particularly in rural areas and along transport corridors is emphasised. At present, more than 70% of public charging points are located in Guangdong Province and Shanghai. In order to achieve these goals, the government aims to install community charging facilities, construct urban and rural public charging networks, improve facility maintenance and enhance power supply. Various regions throughout China offer subsidies for EV charging infrastructure. The central government aims to encourage local governments to strengthen subsidy programmes, particularly for subsidies targeted at operations such as high quality service stations, demonstration projects for high power charging and vehicle grid interaction.

The central government aims to encourage local governments to strengthen subsidy programmes, particularly for subsidies targeted at operations such as high quality service stations, demonstration projects for high power charging and vehicle grid interaction. It further seeks to enhance battery swapping through technical innovation, support for standards and to promote application of technology. Of significant importance, the National Development and Reform Commission and the National Energy Administration (the departments responsible for EV charging infrastructure delivery) announced the Opinion on Further Improving the Service Guarantee Capability of Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure to reinforce quality and safety supervision, to establish operational subsidy standards linked to service quality at the local level with increasing subsidies for new technologies, to support power grid construction, R&D and new technology applications, and the standardised development of charging facilities. In October 2021, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology launched pilot programmes for battery swapping technologies in 11 cities with the goal of building 1 000 battery swap stations and producing more than 100 000 vehicles capable of battery swapping. The Ministry of Transport 14th FYP explicitly states the need to support the construction of charging stations in highway service areas, transportation hubs, logistic parks and bus stations. China’s State Council released their 14th FYP for the Development of a Modern Integrated Transport System, which highlights the need to plan for constructing convenient, efficient and moderately advanced charging and battery swap networks, particularly in key areas. The 14th FYP for areas such as Shanghai, Chongqing, Guangxi, Guangzhou and Shaanxi include either EV charging targets, financial subsidies or an increased focus on developing charging infrastructure. Currently, regions around China offer capital and operational subsidies that can vary significantly in the amounts offered between areas.

Achieving this will require massive investments in charging infrastructure, one study estimates that EUR 20 billion (USD 23.6 billion) would be needed to meet the 2030 target. Actions to achieve the target and as part of the Fit-for-55 package of proposals, in July 2021, the European Commission proposed to transform the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Directive into the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR). Adoption of the AFIR would automatically and uniformly obligate all member states to meet the targets set under binding legislation without having to transpose them into national laws. The regulation also aims to address issues related to a lack of central co-ordination of strategic charging infrastructure networks and interoperability, due to a disjointed approach to EV charging network distribution. Under AFIR, member states would be required to provide 1 kW of power output for every registered light-duty BEV in their jurisdiction and 0.66 kW for every light-duty PHEV. Minimum power and distance targets have also been proposed along main road corridors such as the trans-European network for transport (TEN-T). For the first time, mandatory minimum power and distance targets have been set for HDVs: every 60 km of the core TEN-T network with a power output of at least 1 400 kW (at least one individual power output of 350"}

For the comprehensive network, targets remain the same but shift forward to 2030 and 2035 with a maximum distance of 100 km. In addition, the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Facility, as part of the EU Connecting Europe Facility transport programme, will make EUR 1.5 billion (USD 1.77 billion) available by the end of 2023 for electric fast charging and hydrogen refuelling stations on the TEN-T network. A proposed revision of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive aims to complement more ambitious targets under AFIR. The directive revises mandatory requirements for at least one charging point in non-residential buildings and enables pre-cabling for installation at a later date. Similar revisions were proposed for new residential buildings. Another important update in the European Union has been the proposal to revise the Renewable Energy Directive II, which sets a target to reduce the GHG intensity of transport fuels by 13% by 2030. The revision proposes a new credit mechanism to promote electric mobility, allowing renewable electricity suppliers that provide energy through public charging stations to earn credits on the electricity sold to consumers. This provision can help to improve the business case Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 85 Policies for EV deployment for charging stations. Additional provisions in the proposal include ensuring smart charging capabilities for normal power private charging stations and possibilities for requiring vehicle-to-grid functionalities based on individual member state assessments. In 2021, a number of EU member states allocated significant funding to EV charging infrastructure, making use of the EUR 672.5 billion (USD 796 billion) recovery stimulus package provided by the European Union. Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain and Sweden are the main member states to have applied additional funding to augment their EV charging infrastructure networks in 2021. Further, Sweden announced funding of Swedish kronor (SEK) 550 million (USD 63.9 million) in early 2022 for HDV charging infrastructure along key transport corridors. In the Netherlands, the National Knowledge Platform for Charging Infrastructure (NKL) has developed a Roadmap for deployment of a HDV charging network. NKL will oversee the Living Lab project consisting of testing heavy-duty charging solutions. India Number of electric LDVs per public charging point: 32 Number of public charging points per thousand LDV stock: 0.02 To date, the FAME II programme has provided subsidies (INR 10 billion, USD 135 million) to develop almost 2 900 charging stations across 25 states. In late 2021, the National Highways Authority of India set an objective to install EV charging stations every 40-60 km along national highways, covering 35 000- 40 000 km of highways by 2023. In January 2022, the Ministry of Power revised its guidelines and standards for EV charging infrastructure. The revisions include: easing provisions for EV owners to charge at home/office using existing electricity connections; a revenue-sharing model related to land use to make charging stations more economical; guidance on providing affordable tariffs; timelines for connectivity of charging stations to the grid; and a fixed ceiling on service charges for electricity. India’s national government budget announcement for 2022-2023, includes provisions for a battery swapping policy that aims to provide “batteries or energy as a service”. In April 2022, the government (led by NITI Aayog) released a draft proposal of the policy which is open to comments from stakeholders until June. Key elements include: technical and operational requirements for interoperability, safety and performance between EVs, batteries and EVSE; development of unique identification numbers for batteries and swapping stations; testing and certification standards for battery swapping components; open and flexible mandate to enable different battery-as-a-service business models; expanding existing demand-side fiscal support measures (such as FAME II) to include battery swapping; preferential electricity tariffs for public battery swapping stations; and developing Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 86 Policies for EV deployment standards for the re-use and repurposing of end-of-life EV batteries.

Japan Number of electric LDVs per public charging point: 12 Number of public charging points per thousand LDV stock: 0.4 Japan’s current target is to deploy 150 000 EV charging points by 2030. It allocated a total of JPY 37.5 billion (USD 342 million) to support ZEV deployment of which JPY 12.5 billion (USD 114 million) is for new EV charging and hydrogen refuelling stations. Korea Number of electric LDVs per public charging point: 3 Number of public charging points per thousand LDV stock: 5 In order to meet EV and charging infrastructure targets, Korea almost tripled eligible funding in 2022 compared with 2021 for slow chargers from KRW 24 billion to KRW 74 billion (USD 21 million to USD 65 million). Funding for fast chargers also increased from KRW 4.5 billion (USD 3.9 million) in 2021, to KRW 37 billion (USD 32 million). The funding is expected to increase the number of charging points for apartments and facilities from 8 000 to 30 000 in 2022. Thailand Number of electric LDVs per public charging point: 15 Number of public charging points per thousand LDV stock: 0.16 Today, Thailand has a little more than 1 500 public charging stations. Its ambitions are high. The National Electric Vehicle Policy Committee sets EV production and use targets as well as infrastructure targets. The target is 12 000 fast-charging stations and 1 450 electric motorcycle battery swapping stations by 2030. Thailand plans to use public-private partnerships to install more than 1 000 fast chargers every 50 km along the designated charging network. EGAT, the state-owned electricity generating authority, plans to increase the number of EV charging stations across all travel routes and has signed contracts with six automakers to launch a mobile app that allows customers to locate charging stations. Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 87 Policies for EV deployment United Kingdom Number of electric LDVs per public charging point: 21 Number of public charging points per thousand electric LDVs: 1.0 The EV infrastructure strategy has allocated GBP 1.6 billion (USD 2.3 billion) since 2020 to support deployment of EV charging infrastructure. The strategy introduces numerous government funding schemes, including the GBP 950 million (USD 1.4 billion) Rapid Charging Fund to ensure an ultra rapid charging network along motorways.Other government investments include a GBP 500 million (USD 714 million) Local EV Infrastructure Fund to help local authorities scale up infrastructure deployment, and an On-Street Residential Chargepoint Scheme that will provide GBP 20 million (USD 29 million) through 2022-2023 for the provision of public charging for residents without private parking. Legislation proposed in late 2021 would require EV charging infrastructure in new buildings and major renovations similar to the EU’s Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. United States Number of electric LDVs per public charging point: 18 Number of public charging points per thousand LDV stock: 0.47 The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, adopted in November 2021, allocates USD 5 billion funding under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program to develop a national public EV charging network along designated “Alternative Fuel Corridors”, particularly along the interstate highway system. In addition, the EV Vehicle Charging Action Plan allocates USD 2.5 billion for areas that have historically received minimal investment in EV charging infrastructure such as rural and disadvantaged communities. The investment package is to underpin the US target to deploy 500 000 EV chargers and is the largest investment to date in its charging infrastructure. The United States currently has more than 100 000 public chargers. At the state level, the California Public Utilities Commission approved new rules that require utilities to ensure the provision of electrical distribution infrastructure associated with EV charging stations. Previously customers that did not qualify for utility programmes had to bear the costs. The new rules create an even playing field for all customers and ultimately reduces the cost of installing EV charging stations by 25%.

Electromobility offers countries and regions a variety of opportunities to leapfrog carbon-intensive transport transport patterns to support economic efficiency and bypass or alleviate negative impacts such as air pollution and traffic congestion and to foster domestic manufacturing and service capacity for EVs. Some countries are taking steps to develop appropriate regulatory and investment-ready frameworks to support EV uptake and production, and battery manufacturing. Policies and measures being employed include: national electric mobility strategies; fiscal incentives such as tax benefits and publicprivate partnerships; R&D support; and pilot and demonstration projects tailored for transport modes applicable to their situation, i.e. two/three-wheelers, shared mobility, taxis and buses. Broadening the deployment of EVs in these countries/regions face additional challenges. For example, their stock may be heavily dependent on second-hand vehicles with EVs becoming available with a time lag. Deployment of charging infrastructure may be inhibited in regions with weak grids. Few have established emissions standards or they may be too low to serve as a driver to spur EV uptake. 21 A green paper is a document published by government to stimulate discussion on a given issue, so as to inform changes to existing legislation and/or to create new legislation. This section highlights some of the EV-related policies in emerging market and developing economies that are not covered in the previous sections. It also summarises a global EV support initiative of the Global Environment Facility. Africa Only a small share of vehicle sales on the continent are EVs. South Africa is the market leader. Its uYilo eMobility Programme, established in 2013, is a multi-stakeholder platform that seeks to enable EV deployment through pilot projects and capacity development. It consists of a battery testing and systems laboratory for component modelling, and a smart grid simulator. South Africa’s Department of Trade, Industry and Competition released a green paper21 in 2021 on the advancement of new energy vehicles. Its proposed policy instruments are to reduce the ad valorem tax and eliminate duties on EV components, which currently are subject to an import duty of 25% compared to 18% for an equivalent ICE vehicle. Currently, there are about 300 public EV charging points in South Africa. The government has chosen to mainly let private sector actors take the initiative to deploy EV charging infrastructure. Outlined in the Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 91 Policies for EV deployment Green Transport Strategy, the government aims to work with the private sector to expand the number of EV charging stations powered by renewable sources. In 2015, BMW and Nissan signed a Memorandum of Understanding to jointly plan and build a national network of charging stations to be used by their vehicles. In 2018, this network was expanded with the launch of the Jaguar Powerway, a network of 22 charging stations along major highways plus 30 charging stations in major hubs. More recently, Audi partnered with GridCars to install ultra-fast (150 kW) and fast (22 kW – 80 kW) public charging stations across the country. Elsewhere in Africa, Rwanda has identified that the total investment needed for EV charging infrastructure needs to be scaled up to around USD 900 million to be in line with their climate commitments as set out in"}

In April 2021, the Ministry of Infrastructure released a strategic paper on electric mobility adaptation, which outlines a strategy for implementing various incentives to promote deployment. One measure proposes a preferential corporate income tax rate of 15% for firms operating in emobility modes. In Kenya, electrification of road transport has been identified as a key component to achieve the goal of reducing emissions by 3.46 million tonnes of carbon-dioxide equivalent by 2030 across the transport sector. To support this target, a reduction in excise duty for BEVs (carrying more than ten people) from 20% to 10% was proposed, 22 Various EV-related plans are on hold in Egypt due to the Covid-19 pandemic. along with a target of 5% of imported vehicles to be electric by 2025. In January 2022, ROAM, a Swedish-Kenyan company formerly called Opibus, introduced its first African designed and manufactured electric bus in Kenya. This broadened its focus from domestic production of electric motorcycles and off-road vehicles since its inception in 2017. This is the first major step toward ROAM’s goal of demonstrating EV deployment in emerging markets and expanding to several markets. In Uganda, Kiira Motors, the state-owned vehicle manufacturer, announced plans to launch production of EVs in 2021, with ambition to expand within the next few years. In Egypt, electric cars less than three years old have been given a 100% exemption from customs duties, despite a countrywide ban on importing used vehicles since 2013.22 This ban was reinforced with a presidential decree on import tariffs in 2018. Pilot projects are underway for electric buses in major cities. The Ministry of Military Production signed a partnership with Chinese automaker Foton Motors to produce 500 electric buses per year with at least 45% local components. Over the next four years, the partnership aims to produce 2 000 electric buses. Southeast Asia While EV deployment is in its infancy in Viet Nam, national planning documents state the ambition to advance the uptake of EVs. Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 92 Policies for EV deployment Recently, the government enacted a decree that set registration fees for EVs to zero starting in March 2022 through to February 2027. After which, registration fees will increase to 50% of those applied to conventional vehicles. In 2021, Indinesia’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources indicated that a National Grand Energy Strategy was currently under development, which seeks to support the goal of achieving 2 million electric LDVs and 13 million electric motorcycle stock by 2030. This is coupled with a target to cut oil imports by 77 000 barrels/day by reducing fuel consumption, which will directly impact ICE vehicles and support the uptake of ZEVs. Although not yet reflected in government documentation, an ambition was recently announced for all new cars sold to be EVs by 2050. Other incentives include beneficial tax incentives on HEVs and ZEVs under its luxury sales tax. Existing policy to support these targets includes the Low-Carbon Emission Vehicle Program. Indonesia’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources introduced the Regulation on the Provision of Charging Infrastructure for BEVs in 2020. It aims to support businesses to establsih three types of business schemes: provider; retailer; and co-operation schemes as well as easing licensing procedures for charging stations. Across Indonesian cities, the Ministry of Transport is exploring ways to adopt battery electric buses. The DAMRI E-Bus Project, which aims to replace diesel buses with electric buses, is in the first phase of scale up of electric transport in and around Jakarta. In Thailand, a package of incentives to promote EV deployment was announced in February 2022. Measures include purchase subsidies for BEVs ranging from Thai Baht (THB) 70 000 (USD 2 191) (with a battery capacity of 10-30 kWh) to THB 150 000 (USD 4 695) (with battery capacity higher than 30 kWh), along with reductions in excise tax (until 2025) and import duties (until 2023).

Among the measures are a full tax exemption for locally assembled BEVs, and exemption from import and excise duties for imported BEVs. A 100% road tax exemption is also provided for BEVs, along with income tax benefits for EV charging. Latin America Chile continues to be the market leader in terms of electromobility deployment in the region, as discussed in previous sections. Other countries in South America are ramping up EV-related activities and ambitions. In Colombia, the city of Bogotá has a procurement process to acquire a target of 1 485 electric buses in 2022. Companies such as BYD and Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 93 Policies for EV deployment Transdev have established supply and service contracts with the city. Currently less than 260 of the electric buses are in operation. Approved in July 2021, Law 2099 in Colombia aims to promote efficient use of energy resources and to expand the use of nonconventional energy sources. Based on the law, the Ministry of Mines and Energy granted an exemption from the 20% energy consumption tax for electricity destined for EV charging in public stations and the public transport system. Costa Rica provides incentives to support its ZEV targets. In a major step towards the electrification of road transport, the government is looking to reform a law, due to expire at the end of 2022, for the advancement and support for electric transportation. Established in 2018, the existing law includes several economic benefits for the purchase of new EVs and non-monetary perks for BEV and FCEV owners such as import tax exemptions and ownership tax exemptions. It also augments points for EVs in competitive procurements, mandates EVs for bus replacements and sets minimum requirements for new taxi registrations to be EVs. Currently under discussion, the reform (Number 22.713) of the law would look to extend the incentives and tax benefits and exemptions. Costa Rica’s 2019 National Decarbonization Plan 2018-2050 sets a target for a decarbonised economy with net zero emissions by 2050. Among the ten decarbonisation paths proposed, three are directly related to the transportation sector and include: transformation of public transport and LDV fleets to ZEVs by 2050, and transformation of freight to achieve net zero or the lowest emissions possible. In 2021, a demonstration project was carried out with three all-electric buses operated in an urban and an interurban bus route. The buses were donated by the German government. Global E-Mobility Programme The Global E-Mobility Programme provides support to low- and middle-income countries and their shift to electromobility. The fiveyear programme, co-funded by the Global Environmental Facility (GEF), other organisations and bilateral donors, consists of one global project and is executed by a number of organisations including the Asian Development Bank, Centro de Mario Molina, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, International Energy Agency, United Nations Environment Programme and national governments. The Programme covers more than 50 countries of which 27 countries receive financial support for technical assistance and projects from GEF Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 94 Prospects for EV deployment 3 Prospects for EV deployment Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 95 Prospects for EV deployment Outlook for electromobility Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 96 Prospects for EV deployment Scenarios This section explores several pathways to electrify road transport in the period to 2030.

It takes a scenario approach based on the latest market data, policy drivers and technology perspectives. Two IEA scenarios – the Stated Policies and Announced Pledges scenarios – inform the outlooks which are examined in relation to the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario at the global level. The purpose of the scenarios is to assess plausible futures for global EV markets and their implications. They do not make predictions about the future. Rather, they aim to provide insights to inform decision making by governments, companies and stakeholders about the future of EVs. The scenario projections related to GDP are based on the International Monetary Fund’s most recent publication (19 April 2022), which reflects impacts from the Russian Federation’s (“Russia” herafter) invasion of Ukraine. Given the unpredictability of how the geopolitical situation and its implications for energy markets will evolve raises the level of uncertainty in this edition of the Global EV Outlook projections in the period to 2030. Stated Policies Scenario The Stated Policies Scenario reflects existing policies and measures, as well as policy ambitions and targets that have been legislated by governments around the world. It includes current EV-related policies and regulations and future developments based on the expected impacts of announced deployments and plans from industry stakeholders. The Stated Policies Scenario aims to hold up a mirror to the plans of policy makers and illustrate their consequences. Announced Pledges Scenario The Announced Pledges Scenario assumes that the announced ambitions and targets made by governments around the world, including the most recent ones, are met in full and on time. With regards to electromobility, it includes all recent major announcements of electrification targets and longer term net zero emisssions and other pledges, regardless of whether or not these have been anchored in legislation or in updated Nationally Determined Contributions. For example, the Announced Pledges Scenario assumes that countries that have signed on to the COP26 declaration on accelerating the transition to 100% zero emissions cars and vans will achieve this goal even if there are not yet policies or regulations in place to support it. In countries that have not yet made a net zero emissions pledge or set electrification targets, the Announced Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 97 Prospects for EV deployment Pledges Scenario considers the same policy framework as in the Stated Policies Scenario. Non-policy assumptions for the Announced Pledges Scenario, including population and economic growth, are the same as in the Stated Policies Scenario. Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario The Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (Net Zero Scenario) is a normative scenario that sets out a narrow but achievable pathway for the global energy sector to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. The scenario is compatible with limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5 °C with no or limited temperature overshoot, in line with reductions assessed in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C. There are many possible paths to achieve net zero CO2 emissions globally by 2050 and many uncertainties that could affect any of them. Therefore the Net Zero Scenario is a path and not the path to net zero emissions. Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 98 Prospects for EV deployment Recent trends in EV sales and government policies bring projected EV adoption closer to being on track with the trajectory to net zero emissions by 2050 Global EV stock by mode and scenario, 2021-2030 IEA.

This is driven by the combined effects of technology availability and maturity, policy support and the sheer size of the market. In the Stated Policies Scenario, the electric LDV stock rises from about 17 million in 2021 (95% of the total EV market) to nearly 70 million vehicles in 2025 and over 190 million vehicles in 2030, remaining over 95% of total EVs through 2030. Globally, the share of electric LDVs in the total stock of LDVs increases from just over 1% today to 10% in 2030. Sales of electric LDVs rise from almost 7 million in 2021 to over 17 million in 2025 (a sales share of about 15%) and over 30 million in 2030 (more than 20%). In the Announced Pledges Scenario, about 265 million electric LDVs are projected to be circulating worldwide by 2030 (of which less than 25 million are LCVs), corresponding to an almost 15% share in the LDV stock. Sales of electric LDVs are projected to reach 45 million in 2030 (a sales share of 35%), 50% above the Stated Policies Scenario. These results reflect government net zero emissions pledges and electrification targets, including the COP26 declaration on accelerating the transition to 100% zero emissions cars and vans. In the Net Zero Scenario, the sales share of electric LDVs is more than 60% in 2030, which is over one-and-a-half times higher than in the Stated Policies Scenario and 80% higher than in the Announced Pledges Scenario. Buses The global electric bus fleet is the second-largest EV market today when excluding two/three-wheelers; it increases from 670 000 in 2021 to 1.7 million in 2025 and 3 million in 2030 in the Stated Policies Scenario, representing over 5% and 11% stock shares, respectively. Most of the electrification is limited to urban buses, in particular, driven by efforts to reduce air pollution. Intercity buses have lower levels of electrification, as they have longer routes and require longer charging times. In the Stated Policies Scenario, electric buses reach just under 20% sales share in 2030.

In the Announced Pledges Scenario, the deployment of electric buses accelerates to about 4.5 million in 2030, corresponding to over 15% of the stock. In 2030, almost one-third of buses sold are electric, a 50% higher sales share than in the Stated Policies Scenario. In the Net Zero Scenario, electrification of buses is further accelerated to a 55% sales share and almost 25% stock share in 2030. Medium- and heavy-duty trucks There are over 65 000 electric trucks in operation today. In the Stated Policies Scenario the electric truck fleet expands to 2.8 million in 2030, reaching about 2.5% of the total truck stock. In the Announced Pledges Scenario, the electric truck stock reaches over 3 million (a 2.8% stock share) based on government net zero emissions pledges and electrification targets. In terms of sales, the share of electric trucks in total sales today is very small, but rises to 7% over the projection period (10% in the Announced Pledges Scenario). The Announced Pledges Scenario incorporates the memorandum of understanding on zero emissions medium- and heavy-duty vehicles signed by 15 countries, which has an interim goal of 30% zero emission vehicle sales by 2030 (which includes buses). Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 101 Prospects for EV deployment Electric trucks are particularly well suited for deliveries in urban areas and other applications where driving distances are relatively short (<300 km/day) and overnight charging is possible. However, the electrification of trucks is projected to be the lowest of all vehicle segments in the near term, in part because long-haul trucking requires further technology improvements for high power charging and/or large batteries. Despite these challenges, electric heavy-duty trucks may reach cost parity, on a total cost of ownership basis by 2030 in some regions, such as European countries, especially considering the lower operational costs. While, HDV fuel economy standards are currently not stringent enough to require electrification for compliance and other policy or regulatory measures, such as zero emissions vehicle mandates, tend to be less ambitious than for their LDV counterparts, there are signals that this could be changing. For example, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed a new rule for clean trucks, which is expected to increase the stringency of GHG emissions standards for a subset of trucks and buses. In the Net Zero Scenario, the sales share of electric trucks reaches around 25% in 2030, three-and-a-half times higher than in the Stated Policies Scenario and two-and-a-half times higher than in the Announced Pledges Scenario. This underlines the need for further government ambitions and the need to implement the required policies to put trucks on a pathway to reaching net zero emissions by 2050. 23 Tracking sales of electric two/three-wheelers is not an easy task, as definitions vary across countries. Often electric bicycles are included in the statistics. Our accounting aims to include only vehicles that fit the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) definition of L2-L5. Two/three-wheelers Two/three-wheelers23 are relatively easy to electrify because their light weight and short driving distances require relatively small batteries, which also raises fewer issues related to charging infrastructure requirements. On a total cost of ownership basis, electrification already makes economic sense in many regions. With a sales share higher than 20% in 2021 (6% stock share), two/three-wheelers are the most electrified road transport segment today. Electric two/three-wheelers are projected to continue to be the largest EV fleet among all road transport modes. Asia, where two/threewheelers are prevalent today, is the main centre of growth. The global stock of electric two/three-wheelers in the Stated Policies Scenario increases from over 35 million in 2021 to 245 million in 2030, accounting for over a quarter of the total stock in 2030.24 Sales of electric two/three-wheelers increase from almost 10 million in 2021 to 40 million in 2030, when they account for more than half of all sales. In the Announced Pledges Scenario, the global stock of electric two/three-wheelers rises to over 330 million in 2030, 35% of the total stock for two/three-wheelers. This corresponds to sales close to 55 million in 2030, amounting for about 65% of all sales. In the Net Zero Scenario, electric two/three-wheelers reach a sales share of 85% in 2030, 60% and 30% higher than the Stated Policies and Announced Pledges scenarios, respectively.

In the LDV market, current trends suggest that the government’s target of a 20% sales share in 2025 may actually be achieved earlier. The combined effects of policy support and the increasing availability of affordable models in particular in the small car segment mean that the 20% share is reached by 2023 in the Stated Policies and the Announced Pledges scenarios. By 2030, the share of electric LDVs reaches 45% of all LDVs sales in the Stated Policies Scenario and 46% in the Announced Pledges Scenario. China is currently the world leader in the electrification of buses and two/three-wheelers. China has the highest stock share of electric buses in the world, at over 10%, due in part to the large number of EV bus models available. The stock share of electric buses in 2030 is over 25% in the Stated Policies Scenario and over 35% in the Announced Pledges Scenario. For two/three-wheelers, over one-fifth of the stock is electric. China is projected to continue leading these markets to 2030 in both scenarios. Electric two/three-wheelers attain a stock share of 60% in 2030 in the Stated Policies Scenario and over 75% in the Announced Pledges Scenario. China also continues to lead in terms of the share of electric two/three-wheelers and buses in overall sales in both scenarios to 2030. The gap relative to other countries closes, especially in the Announced Pledges Scenario, reflecting other countries’ ambitions to electrify buses. While the current sales share of electric medium- and heavy-duty trucks is still less than 1% in China, it rises to 13% sales share in 2030 in the Stated Policies Scenario, higher than other major markets. The electric truck sales share remains similar in the Announced Pledges Scenario, as the sales are already on a trajectory to meet its carbon neutrality by 2060 ambition. Thus, in the Announced Pledges Scenario, China reaches a similar level of electrification of trucks as the United States, but lower than in Europe. In China, the sales share of EVs across all road transport segments (excluding two/three-wheelers) reaches around 45% in 2030 in both the Stated Policies Scenario and the Announced Pledges Scenario. The existing policy framework and targets to 2030 in China as considered in the Stated Policies Scenario are designed to meet China’s long-term carbon neutrality target, making the two scenarios similar in terms of EV shares. In addition, electrification of road transport is an important policy priority in China and market dynamics are strong, suggesting that individual targets may be achieved sooner than expected and thus our projections exceed stated targets."}

Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 104 Prospects for EV deployment Europe CO2 emission standards for both LDVs and heavy commercial vehicles in the European Union are expected to promote EV adoption across modes and maintain Europe’s position as one of the most advanced EV markets in the coming years. In the Stated Policies Scenario, the sales share of electric LDVs reaches over 35% in 2030. The Announced Pledges Scenario considers the European Union’s proposal to reduce emissions from cars and vans by 55% and 50% by 2030 (compared with 1990), as well as the United Kingdom’s proposed ICE ban for new PLDV sales in 2030 and the COP26 declaration on accelerating the transition to 100% zero emissions cars and vans. As such, electric LDVs reach a sales share of over 50% in Europe in 2030 in the Announced Pledges Scenario (about 55% in the European Union). The European Union Clean Vehicles Directive sets minimum requirements for the procurement of zero emissions public buses and trucks. In the Stated Policies Scenario, the sales share of EVs in Europe is nearly 50% for buses and 7% for trucks in 2030 (55% and 10%, respectively, for the European Union). Given the European Union’s net zero emissions by 2050 pledge, in addition to a number of European countries signing on to the MOU on Zero Emissions Medium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicles, the EV sales shares in the Announced Pledges Scenario increases to over 55% of buses and 20% of trucks (over 60% and 20% in the European Union). In Europe, the EV sales share across all modes is over 35% by 2030 in the Stated Policies Scenario. In the Announced Pledges Scenario, by 2030, Europe has a combined EV sales share of 50% (for electric LDVs, buses and trucks). United States Under the current administration, the United States has enacted more stringent fuel economy standards and passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (referred to as the infrastructure law) that includes funding for EV chargers. Both are expected to boost electric LDV market uptake. In the Stated Policies Scenario, the United States achieves more than 20% sales share of electric LDVs in 2030. In the Announced Pledges Scenario, it meets the 2030 target of 50% EV PLDV sales, reaching that level across all LDVs. The 2021 infrastructure law also includes grants for buses and related facilities, with a provision that at least 25% of funds must be dedicated to projects for low or zero emissions buses. In addition, California’s Innovative Clean Transit regulation requires 100% of new purchases by public transit agencies to be zero emissions buses from 2029, with the goal to achieve a full transition to zero emissions buses by 2040. As a result, the electric bus sales share in the United States reaches 30% in 2030 in the Stated Policies Scenario. The Announced Pledges Scenario assumes an acceleration of the electrification of buses is needed to achieve the net zero by 2050 target, reaching a sales share of over 40% in 2030. Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 105 Prospects for EV deployment Since California passed the Advanced Clean Truck regulation in 2020, five other states (Oregon, Washington, New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts) have adopted the regulation, which requires zero emissions truck sales to reach 30-50%, depending on class, in 2030. In the Stated Policies Scenario, the United States sees an electric truck sales share of 6% in 2030. This increases to 12% in the Announced Pledges Scenario, accounting for net zero ambitions and that additional states are considering to adopt the Advanced Clean Truck regulation. Although, the US EPA proposed a new rule for clean trucks in March 2022, this proposal has not been included in scenario projections, as the EPA is requesting comments on the appropriateness of further increasing the stringency of the GHG emissions standards beyond what is in the current proposal. In the United States, the EV sales share across all modes (excluding two/three-wheelers) is 20% in 2030 in the Stated Policies Scenario and almost 50% in the Announced Pledges Scenario.

Buses are expected to electrify at a faster rate than LDVs, reaching almost 30% of sales in the Stated Policies Scenario and over half of sales in the Announced Pledges Scenario in 2030. In the Stated Policies Scenario, by 2030 EV sales share in Japan across all modes (excluding two/three-wheelers) reach about 20%. In the Announced Pledges Scenario, EV sales shares are 30% across all modes (except two/three-wheelers). India India has placed an emphasis on electrifying two-wheelers, as evidenced by the 50% increase in purchase incentives for twowheelers in the modifications to the FAME II scheme and local policies such as in Delhi. The sales share of electric two/threewheelers increases from 2% in 2021 to almost 50% in 2030 in the Stated Policies Scenario and further to 60% in the Announced Pledges Scenario. The rate of electrification of buses and LDVs is lower, reaching 6% and 12% in 2030 in the Stated Policies Scenario, respectively. In the Announced Pledges electric buses attain around 25% sales share and LDVs about 30% sales share in 2030, reflecting India signing on to the COP26 declaration to transition to 100% zero emissions LDV sales by 2040. EV sales share across all modes (including two/three-wheelers) in India is above 30% in 2030 in the Stated Policies Scenario (just over 10% excluding two/three-wheelers). In the Announced Pledges Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 106 Prospects for EV deployment Scenario, EV sales shares in India scale up to almost 45% in 2030 across all road vehicle modes (30% excluding two/three-wheelers). Other regions A number of countries around the world have not yet developed a clear vision or set targets for electromobility. Notably the Global E-Mobility Programme is working with governments to advance deployment of EVs. A lack of fiscal incentives for EVs, charging infrastructure availability, and higher purchase price hurdles contribute to lower EV sales shares in many countries. Across other regions, in the Stated Policies Scenario, the EV sales shares averages about 6% for both LDVs and buses, and 1% for trucks in 2030. The Announced Pledges Scenario results in higher electrification across the world, though emerging market and developing economies tend to lag behind the more advanced markets in terms of electrification and net zero emissions ambitions. In the Announced Pledges Scenario, the other region category averages EV shales shares of 15% for LDVs and buses and 3% for trucks. However, some of these countries, e.g. Canada, Chile, Colombia, Israel, Korea, Pakistan and New Zealand, have adopted policies and other measures to support vehicle electrification and have net zero emissions pledges, and therefore have significantly higher sales shares than the averages listed above. For example, Canada’s EV sales share across modes (excluding two/three-wheelers) is more than 25% in the Stated Policies Scenario and over 50% in the Announced Pledges Scenario. Similarly, Korea averages an EV sales share of around 30% across modes in the Stated Policies Scenario and over 50% in the Announced Pledges Scenario.

Recently, announcements pertaining to LDVs have multiplied, and heavy-duty vehicle OEMs have also established ZEV targets. Two major initiatives that aim to transition to ZEVs were announced at COP26 in late 2021. The declaration on accelerating the transition to 100% zero emissions cars and vans unites public and private sector actors who want to work towards the sale of ZEVs exclusively by 2040 (and 2035 in leading markets). For HDVs, the Global Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Zero Emissions Medium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicles aims to achieve 30% ZEV sales shares for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles in 2030, and 100% ZEV sales by 2040. Around 40 private sector stakeholders, including heavy-duty OEMs, have also endorsed the MoU. OEM announcements are most ambitious in Europe, and also quite ambitious in China, which may well reflect the level of policy ambition and commitments to transition to net zero emissions by 2050 in the European Union and by 2060 in China. OEM announcements in the United States lag in comparison. For most regions, the EV sales shares implied by the collective sum of all OEM announcements are more ambitious than the IEA’s assessment of government pledges, as tracked in the Announced Pledges Scenario. China All the top international car manufacturers in China have announced electrification pledges that range from 50% to 85% by 2030 or 2035. Similarly, smaller Chinese OEMs have clear electrification targets for the end of this decade. BYD, a major Chinese automaker, endorsed the Global MoU on Zero Emissions Medium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicles. Beyond this, Jeifang, the market leader in HDVs in China, has announced its goal to reach 20% sales shares of new energy vehicles by 2025, 50% by 2030, and 70% by 2035. Another major HDV maker, Beiqi Foton, aims to sell 20 000 new energy HDVs by 2025. Europe All major OEMs active in Europe have pledged to electrify the majority of their sales between 2030 or 2035. For example, Volkswagen and Stellantis, which together make up about 30% of Europe’s automotive market by volume, have pledged to sell 70% and 100% EVs, respectively, by 2030. A joint statement was signed by the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research that targets 100% ZEV heavy-duty vehicle sales by 2040. For instance, Scania has pledged to offer an electric Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 109 Prospects for EV deployment model in every medium- and heavy-duty vehicle segment by 2025. Signatories of the statement collectively make up more than 90% of Europe’s HDV market. United States OEMs in the United States have recently announced very ambitious electrification targets, with both Ford and General Motors aiming to exclusively sell ZEVs by 2035. Pure electric vehicle OEMs also play an important role. If Tesla’s production plans are successful, they would significantly contribute to the United States and global EV market share by 2030. Among the major heavy-duty vehicle OEMs operating in the US market, Freightliner Western Star, a subsidiary of Daimler, aims to offer only CO2-neutral HDVs by 2039 in Europe, North America and Japan. The electric bus maker, Proterra, and the ZEV truck start-up, Nikola, have endorsed the Global MoU on Zero Emissions Medium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicles.

It sets a collective aspirational goal for EVs (excluding two/three-wheelers) to reach 30% sales share by 2030 across all signatory countries. This is the benchmark against which progress is to be measured for the EVI members. Fourteen countries and 23 companies and organisations endorsed and support the campaign. Co-ordinated by the IEA, the campaign includes five implementing actions to help achieve the goal in accordance with the priorities and programmes of each EVI member country. These include: • Support and track the deployment of EV chargers. • Galvanise public and private sector commitments to incorporate EVs in company and supplier fleets. • Scale up policy research and information exchange. • Support governments through training and capacity building. • Establish the Global EV Pilot City Programme to achieve 100 EV Friendly Cities over five years. The target of collectively reaching 30% of EV sales by 2030 is now within reach of the Stated Policies Scenario for the campaign signatories. The same target, at a global level is close to the Announced Pledges Scenario. Despite the ambition of the 30% target, for the world to reach net zero emissions by 2050, the market share would need to be twice as high. EV market share IEA. All rights reserved.

Electricity demand from EVs accounts for less than half a percent of current total final electricity consumption worldwide. The expectation is for rapid growth of the EV fleet. Electricity demand for EVs is projected to reach almost 780 TWh in the Stated Policies Scenario and over 1 100 TWh in the Announced Pledges Scenario in 2030. Notably, the Announced Pledges Scenario electricity demand is about 50% higher than in the Stated Policies Scenario, despite the stock of EVs only being 35% higher.

The majority of this difference comes from the reduced number of two/three-wheelers in China. accounts for at least 2% of global final electricity consumption in both scenarios. The EV fleet becomes an increasingly important factor for power systems in both scenarios, with its implications for peak power demand and transmission and distribution capacity being key considerations. Careful planning and fostering smart charging (managed charging to avoid contributing to peak load) is of crucial importance. Encouraging slow charging, the timing of which can be more easily managed to ensure optimal planning, smooth operation and resiliency of power systems, can also help. More than half of EV electricity demand in 2030 in both scenarios is via slow chargers. China remains the largest consumer of electricity for EVs in 2030, although its share in global EV electricity demand decreases significantly (from 60% in 2021 to around 35% in the Stated Policies Scenario and 30% in the Announced Pledges Scenario). This reflects wider adoption of electromobility across other countries in the period to 2030. Expanding the EV stock reduces oil use, which today accounts for over 90% of total final consumption in the transport sector and is a Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 114 Prospects for EV deployment critical energy security consideration. Globally, the projected EV fleet (excluding two and three wheelers) in 2030 displaces about 3.4 million barrels per day (mb/d) of diesel and gasoline in the Stated Policies Scenario and about 4.6 mb/d in the Announced Pledges Scenario, up from about 0.3 mb/d in 2021. For context, Germany consumed around 2 mb/d of oil products across all sectors in 2020. However, the recent price spikes for critical minerals that are important inputs to battery manufacturing, and the tense market situation for key materials such as steel, are a stark reminder that energy security considerations evolve in the transition to electromobility and require regular reconsideration.

Residential charging is a retail business opportunity for utilities, while charging station operators will draw revenue from public charging. Investments are needed now in order to develop adequate charging networks. Not all kWhs cost the same Electricity for home charging is generally priced at residential tariffs while depot charging for commercial vehicles and buses is generally priced at commercial tariffs. Residential rates may be the lowest cost for EV owners. As distributed generation such as from rooftop solar photovoltaics becomes more widespread, at home charging may get cheaper. Electricity from public chargers tends to be more expensive as charging operators need to build in the capital expenditure for the equipment and land acquisition or leasing, as well as higher fixed grid connection costs due to their high power rating. 26 In this section, the market estimation is based on electricity prices and demand by charger type.

This can be attributed to economies of scale in charger manufacturing, decreasing the capital expenditures, as well as higher utilisation rates of the infrastructure and differences in retail electricity markets. EV charging is a growing business opportunity Electricity sales to charge EVs currently accounts for about 55 TWh and are valued at almost USD 8.5 billion per year. The majority of revenue is from residential and depot charging (65%), while public charging takes the remainder of global sales today. China is the largest market with a value of almost USD 4 billion. In the Stated Policies Scenario, the value of the electric charging market increases to USD 135 billion per year by 2030, reaching almost USD 190 billion if governments meet their domestic climate pledges. Europe is set to be the largest market in monetary terms Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 116 Prospects for EV deployment due to higher average prices and a large projected EV stock. China follows suit as its even larger projected fleet has access to cheaper electricity. Today public charging accounts for roughly a third of the charging market as the majority of EVs are charged at home. The current business case for investors in public charging infrastructure is challenging due to low utilisation rates and high grid connection costs. However, by 2030, utilisation rates of public chargers are expected to increase in all markets, significantly improving the business case for charging operators. In particular, the projected market size for fast chargers is expected to be larger than that for slow public chargers.

Suitable access to electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) is essential for electric LDV owners. There are two broad categories of chargers: Private Chargers: These are private chargers located at residences or workplaces (or in the case of some LCVs at a depot). They have power ratings that typically range from 3 kW to 22 kW. Electricity pricing through these chargers is typically similar to residential or commercial tariffs, and thus may offer the cheapest charging option. Today, this is the primary means of EV charging, with an estimated 15 million private charging points worldwide. Two/three-wheelers almost exclusively use private chargers (which can be as simple as a power socket). Publicly accessible chargers. These are street accessible chargers that generally are located in urban areas, such shopping centres, parking garages or other sites, or along transport corridors. Their power ranges from 11 kW to 350 kW for PLDVs. The electricity pricing for public chargers tends to be higher than private chargers since equipment and grid connection costs have to be recovered. Prices tend to be correlated with the power rating – we estimate that ultra-fast chargers (more than 150 kW) sell electricity for about a 40% higher price on average than slow public chargers (i.e. ≤ 22 kW). Public charging networks are needed to enable EV owners to undertake long-distance journeys (such as on highways), and for EV owners without access to a home charger (such as in large cities). Currently, there are about 1.8 million public EV charging points worldwide. EVSE projections for LDVs in this Outlook are based on the expected evolution of charging networks by charger type (i.e. private or public). This in turn depends on the building stock of each country (single family residences versus multi-unit dwellings), which serves as a proxy to represent access to residential chargers. The projections for publicly available chargers are based on region-dependent historical trends regarding the number of EVs per public charger and the EV stock share, where it is generally assumed that as stock share increases over time, the ratio of EVs to public chargers will also increase. Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 121 Prospects for EV deployment Car charging likely to be dominated by private charging The estimated global number of private LDV chargers (residential and workplace) in 2021 is 15 million. As EV penetration increases, an increasing number of private chargers continue to account for the vast majority of charging infrastructure. Private chargers account for 90% of all chargers in both scenarios in 2030, but closer to 60% of installed capacity due to the lower power rating relative to public chargers. In addition, private chargers meet about 65% of the energy demand in both scenarios, 330 TWh in the Stated Policies Scenario and 500 TWh in the Announced Pledges Scenario by 2030. Private charging, at home or workplace, is currently the dominant source of charging in many countries. Access to home chargers is the main determinant of private versus public charging behaviour. Most early adopters of EVs have access and use a home charger as a primary source of charging since they can benefit from lower electricity rates and are not dependent on a small, albeit expanding, public charging infrastructure. For example, today in the United States, 88% of EVs have access to residential charging. Access to residential charging depends largely on the distribution of housing types and the vintage of buildings. Single-unit houses are more likely to have the option to install a residential charger. Newer buildings are more likely to have the required infrastructure to provide private charging to parking spaces. There is significant variation in residential charging accessibility across population groups within a country, as well as across countries. In the United States, for example, 70% of detached single-unit households have access to home charging, while access can be as low as 10-20% for rented apartments. On the other hand, in China only about 40% of households have access to residential parking and fewer have access to a charger. This is common across regions where the majority of people live in multi-unit dwellings with limited parking spaces in urban areas. In"}

This is common across regions where the majority of people live in multi-unit dwellings with limited parking spaces in urban areas. In addition to lower access to residential chargers in China, notable differences in charging behaviour are taken into account as even EV owners that have access to a home charger meet only 50% of their charging demand at home. This can be explained by the widely accessible public charging network with affordable prices in China. Given the current composition of housing types and vehicle ownership, it is estimated that between 50% and 60% of all cars are owned by households that have residential charging access in Europe and the United States (and the share is higher when considering EV ownership). In China, the same value is below 40%. By 2030, less than 15% of the car stock is electric in the Announced Pledges Scenario in most countries. Therefore, the majority of EV owners in 2030 plausibly will continue to have access to a residential charger. In China and European countries with higher EV penetration, with up to 20% of LDV stock being electric, we see a small decline in average residential charging access as more EVs are adopted by multi-unit dwelling households. The increased availability of workplace charging further strengthens the share of private Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 122 Prospects for EV deployment charging. By 2030, the share of energy delivered by private charging is projected to account for roughly 70% of all electricity delivered to electric cars in Europe and the United States, and around half in China. Given the importance of private charging, it is key to ensure that residential and other private parking spaces have access to EV charging. For instance, China’s government target requires fixed parking spaces in newly built residential communities to have charging facilities or meet conditions for installations, which will make residential charging more available. In the European Union, the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (and its more ambitious proposed revision) is expected to enhance residential and workplace charging opportunities. However, the relatively low share of new construction in Europe means that retrofitting of buildings will also have to play an important role. In parallel, policies need to ensure affordable and fair access for people that will rely mostly on public chargers to reduce charging barriers for those living in apartments.

China accounts for 65% of all public chargers. As the number of EVs on the road increases, so does the number of installed publicly accessible chargers. The cost premium for public chargers is likely to decline as economies of scale help to decrease equipment costs; in China, charger costs declined 67% from 2016 to 2019. However, the benefits of economies of scale may be offset by additional costs associated with grid upgrades as further installation of chargers exceeds the limits of the current grid capacity. There are more than 8 million slow public charging points and almost 5 million public fast charging points by 2030 in the Stated Policies Scenario. This accounts for 90 gigawatts (GW) of public slow charging installed capacity and almost 500 GW of public fast installed capacity. Publicly accessible chargers provide a third (170 TWh) of all electricity for EV charging in 2030.

In general, it is assumed that as the stock share of EVs increases as the number of public chargers per EV decreases. However, in the near term, when EV adoption is low, more chargers per vehicle are needed to encourage their uptake, yet until the number of EVs increase the utilisation rate of each charger may be low. This makes it difficult to recover capital costs and earn profit for operators. In this phase, government support can help bolster the economic case for public chargers.

Regional projected EVSE stock data can be interactively explored via the Global EV Data Explorer. As more EVs get on the road, it is expected that the charging networks will be better optimised and utilisation rates will increase. This higher utilisation rate of chargers means that the growth of public chargers from the Stated Policies Scenario to the Announced Pledges Scenario does not need to keep pace with the increase in EVs, as the same number of chargers can provide more energy when utilisation is higher.

Projected ratio of EV per EVSE varies by region While many countries have allocated funds to support EVSE deployment, strategies differ by region. In the European Union obligations are proposed for public chargers based on minimum power per EV (1 kW for each BEV and 0.66 kW for each PHEV). In the Stated Policies Scenario, this minimum requirement would equate to 36 GW of public charging given expected EV deployment, and about 45 GW in the Announced Pledges Scenario. In our projections of public EVSE developments, public charging capacity is about 15% higher. In terms of the number of charging points in the European Union, the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy describes a target of 3 million publicly accessible charging points in 2030. This target is 50% higher than our estimate of 2 million public chargers in 2030 in the Announced Pledges Scenario (a sevenfold increase over the current stock of public chargers in the European Union). In the Announced Pledges Scenario, we estimate 25 electric LDVs per public charger in 2030. In March 2022, the United Kingdom government announced a goal to reach 300 000 public charge points by 2030. This target is aligned with oue estimate of just over 300 000 public charge points in the Announced Pledges Scenario in 2030, an eightfold increase compared to the current stock. Our projections of electric LDV and EVSE stocks would equate to about 35 EVs per charge point, with about 10.5 GW of installed public EVSE capacity to support 7.5 million BEVs and about 3.5 million PHEVs in 2030 in the Announced Pledges Scenario. In the United States, the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act set aside funds to support the target of 500 000 public EV chargers. In the Stated Policies Scenario and the Announced Pledges Scenario, the number of public chargers in the United States reaches over half a million by 2025. By 2030, the estimated number of public chargers is over 1.3 million in the Announced Pledges Scenario (almost a 12-fold increase compared to the current stock), with about 30 EVs per charge point. Thus, it is expected that private company investment will be needed to complement public funding and reach the number of chargers required to support the projected deployment of electric cars. Similarly, in 2021 Japan allocated funding with the ambition to deploy 150 000 charging points by 2030. In the Stated Policies Scenario, the number of public chargers reaches more than 160 000 in 2030 and 180 000 in the Announced Pledges Scenario, representing a five to sixfold increase in the stock of"}

Based on our vehicle projections, and achieving Japan’s target of 30% EV sales share in 2030 in the Announced Pledges Scenario, the targeted 150 000 charge points in 2030 would imply a ratio of over 60 electric LDVs per public charger (even higher than the 50 EVs per charge point in our projections). Almost half of the electric LDV stock in Japan Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 125 Prospects for EV deployment in 2030 is expected to be PHEVs, which will not rely as heavily, if at all, on public charging infrastructure. China aims to increase the total number of charging stations by a factor of 12 by 2025 (13 million slow charging stations and 0.8 million fast charging stations). In both the Stated Policies Scenario and the Announced Pledges Scenario, the estimated number of public chargers reaches less than 4 million in 2025 and about 9 million in 2030, about an eightfold increase in the period to 2030. In our EV projections, China reaches about 40 million electric LDVs in 2025; reaching their EVSE target would imply one public charge point for about every three electric LDVs. Therefore, reaching this target would make the charging network in China significantly more dense than other regions, with a risk of under utilised infrastructure. Our EVSE projections assume China maintains a relatively high ratio of public chargers per EV, however, the ratio is closer to 10 EVs per charge point, despite a decreasing share of residential chargers per EV. Government measures likely to drive an increase in availability of highway EV charging Charging service providers are introducing faster chargers and, in parallel, the fast charging capabilities of EVs are increasing. New technologies, such as 800 Volt power systems are enabling faster charging, a trend that also helps keep charging times short even as batteries increase in size. Chargers located on highways and other main transport corridors are perfect candidates for ultra-fast chargers of up to 350 kW. These types of chargers will be necessary to enable EV owners to seamlessly undertake long road trips. A number of government policies and targets are in place to facilitate and expedite the installation of infrastructure along key highways. In China, the government targets at least 60% of the national highway infrastructure to be covered by charging stations. EV charging planning standards require charging stations to be sited within 50 km of each other on highways that connect major Chinese cities (Shanghai, Suzhou, Xichang and Guangzhou). India aims to install charging stations every 40 – 60 km along its highways. In Europe, the latest AFIR proposal includes gradual requirements to install charging stations every 60 km, in each direction of travel, with minimum charging pool of at least 300 kW by 2025 (with at least one ultra-fast charger) and 600 kW by 2030. Optimal sizing and location of highway charging stations is key, as grid connection costs can be extremely expensive for high power charging stations and such chargers put further strain on power grids. Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 126 Prospects for EV deployment Electrification of buses and trucks requires significant charging capacity per vehicle, but not many chargers Three classifications of chargers are considered: depot charging; destination charging (such as at distribution centres for trucks); and public charging. Depot charging is the cheapest and most convenient form to charge HDVs. Therefore, it is the preferred option, except when trucks and buses have duty cycles where the route length exceeds the electric driving range of the vehicle. In the period to 2030, the adoption of battery electric HDVs is expected to be most rapid for city buses and urban and regional delivery applications with short range routes (under 200 km/day). For these cases, buses and trucks can be expected to rely mainly on depot charging, which can occur overnight or during breaks. As electrification of intercity buses and long-haul trucks increases, public chargers, especially along highways, will be required.

In the Announced Pledges Scenario, the number of bus depot chargers increases to 750 000 with capacity of almost 70 GW. In 2030, the number of opportunity chargers, along routes, for buses is two orders of magnitude lower than depot chargers, reaching less than 3 500 chargers in both scenarios.

By reducing consumption of oil products, the uptake of EVs lowers the amount of revenue that governments derive from oilrelated taxes, which may not be fully compensated by levies on the increased electricity use (assuming current tax rates). The net effect is a tax loss, stemming from the combined effects of lower overall energy consumption (EVs are two-to-four times more efficient than comparable internal combustion engine vehicles) and the different taxation levels of electricity and oil products. Reductions in government taxes due to EVs are limited today, but the scale of the global EV fleet by 2030 implies a possible net fuel tax loss of almost USD 75 billion in the Stated Policies Scenario and USD 90 billion in the Announced Pledges Scenario. Europe is expected to see the largest net loss, around USD 35 billion in 2030, due to the relatively high tax rate on oil products.

However, these short-term measures cannot be protracted in time, as they risk creating distortions and equity issues. In addition, the current volatile oil markets and very high prices at the pump as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine mean that such a measure is unlikely to be practical in the near term.

These, for example, could include coupling higher taxes on carbon-intensive fuels with distance-based charges. Road taxes or distance-based charges applied to EVs serve better as longer term measures, once price parity has been reached, so that EV adoption is not slowed in the short term. Widespread EV adoption will reduce air pollution and GHG emissions, implying reduced health and environmental damages and a reduction in their associated societal costs. Further, well-designed distance-based charges, such ones that vary by time, place and vehicle type, could also address negative externalities including traffic congestion, road infrastructure damage and noise.

As a result, the net GHG emissions avoided from the use of EVs reaches 460 Mt CO2-eq in 2030 in the Stated Policies Scenario. The production of electricity to fuel the EV fleet in 2030 in the Stated Policies Scenario results in 280 Mt CO2-eq emissions, but this is more than offset by the avoidance of 740 Mt CO2-eq that would have been emitted from an equivalent ICE vehicle fleet. In the Announced Pledges Scenario, the GHG benefit of EV adoption increases further both from a higher stock of EVs and a lower GHG intensity of electricity generation. The net GHG emissions avoided in 2030 are nearly 580 Mt CO2-eq, where EVs are responsible for 340 Mt CO2-eq emissions, but also for the displacement of 920 Mt CO2-eq that would have resulted from the equivalent ICE vehicle fleet. Recent IEA analysis indicates that EVs also currently provide lifecycle GHG emissions benefits (accounting for emissions from vehicle manufacturing – including mineral extraction and material production – and vehicle end-of-life, in addition to well-to-wheel emissions) on the order of a 50% reduction compared with conventional ICE vehicles on a global average. Although GHG emissions benefits could be partially eroded by future design aspects, such as an increasing battery size or alternative battery chemistries, it is estimated that overall lifecycle benefits of EVs will continue to increase as the energy system decarbonises, widening the gap between lifecycle GHG emissions of EVs and ICE vehicles.

The low global average utilisation rate is explained by two primary factors. First, there was strategic early investment in battery plant capacity to prepare for projected demand growth. Second, some factories are still ramping up production capacity to reach nameplate capacity, a process that can take from three to six years. Nickel-based battery chemistries remain dominant A key defining feature of batteries is their cathode chemistry, which determines both the battery performance and its material demand. For the automotive sector, three broad categories of cathode chemistry are most relevant today: lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC); lithium nickel cobalt aluminium oxide (NCA); and lithium iron phosphate (LFP). NMC and NCA cathodes have become increasingly dominant as they offer high energy density based on higher nickel content in the cathode. Higher nickel content, however, requires more complex and controlled production processes. LFP is a lower cost and more stable chemistry, with lower risk of catching fire and a longer cycle life. It typically only has 65 - 75% of the energy density compared with a high-nickel NMC such as NMC811, although recent technology innovations have significantly improved their energy density. NCA is used exclusively by Tesla. Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 139 EV batteries and supply chains Nickel-based chemistries, such as NMC and NCA, were dominant in the electric car battery market in 2021 with 75% of cathode material demand share due to their advantages for driving range. However, there has been a major resurgence of LFP over the last two years, reaching an EV cathode material demand share of 25%, mainly driven by the increased uptake of electric cars in China. LFP is still used for most medium- and heavy-duty vehicle applications due to its superior cycle life, which suits intensive usage and frequent charging, and the fact that most electric medium- and heavy-duty vehicles are in China, where LFP is mainly used. The cost advantages for LFP in China became more apparent recently as subsidies that favoured high-nickel chemistries were phased out. Cathode and anode demand surged alongside battery demand in 2021. Demand for cathode material reached 520 kilotonnes (kt), more than doubling from 2020. Demand for anode material also doubled to reach 300 kt. The significantly higher material requirement for cathode material is due to the much higher energy densities of the graphite anodes in comparison to leading cathodes, thus requiring less anode material per cell.

Given high battery metal prices, LFP has become more attractive as it contains no cobalt or nickel, instead using low cost iron and phosphorous (though remaining exposed to rising lithium prices). LFP relies on lithium carbonate rather than hydroxide used for nickel-rich chemistries. The cost advantages of LFP in a high commodity price market are one reason for the resurgence. Another is the recent innovation of cell-to-pack (CTP) technology, eliminating the need for modules to house cells in the battery pack, thereby reducing the dead weight in the pack and improving the energy density of LFP batteries. CTP technology was pioneered by BYD with the Blade battery and it continues to be improved. CATL released their third-generation CTP battery increasing the LFP pack energy density to around 85% of a conventional NMC811 battery. CTP is also being applied to high-nickel chemistries to further improve their energy density. LFP production is mostly limited to China – the traditional main hub for the LFP battery chemistry. One reason for this is LFP patents; the research consortium owning the patents formed an agreement with battery makers in China in which they would not be charged a licence fee for using LFP if only used in China. These patents and licence fees are set to expire in 2022 making production and sales abroad more attractive. Another key reason is the early subsidies in the LFP supply chain in China. LFP is now set to surge globally. Recently, major non-Chinese EV manufacturers, such as Tesla and Volkswagen, announced moves to LFP chemistries for entry-level high volume EV models. Almost half of all Tesla EVs produced in the first-quarter of 2022 used LFP. LFP battery production is now planned in Europe and the United States to meet anticipated LFP demand for EVs in these regions. A surge in LFP poses a challenge for battery recycling as it is difficult to make a profit recovering iron and phosphorous. Without valuable metals such as nickel and cobalt, the value that can be recovered from LFP batteries drops considerably from conventional recycling methods and its economic viability is a concern. LFP appears to require direct recycling to be profitable or will require regulatory intervention, frameworks or alternative business models. – Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 141 EV batteries and supply chains Battery metal prices increased dramatically in early 2022, posing a significant challenge to the EV industry Battery metals prices, 2015 – May 2022 IEA.

Between the start of 2021 and May 2022 lithium prices increased more than sevenfold and cobalt prices more than doubled. Nickel prices almost doubled over the same period reaching levels not seen for almost a decade. The unprecedented battery metal price rises have been caused by a combination of surging battery demand, increasing pressure on supply chains and concerns around tightening supply. The supply constraints have been driven by three trends: first, production challenges caused by the pandemic; second, concerns around Class 1 nickel supply from Russia; and third, structural underinvestment in new supply capacity during the three years preceding 2021 when metal prices were low. Some producers delayed or even curtailed planned projects and expansions due to low lithium prices. For example, the Australian mining company Galaxy Resources reduced lithium mine production at its most important mine by about 40% in 2019 as did other Australian lithium mining companies. The last time there was a price surge in battery metal prices was for lithium and cobalt in 2017 due to optimistic expectations for growth in battery demand, before prices collapsed in 2018. Lithium has reached unprecedented price levels today being almost 200% higher than its previous peak. Cobalt prices are also up sharply in recent months, although they are not yet at at the level experienced at its peak. This likely reflects lower demand expectations due to low cobalt chemistries gaining battery market share."}

Quarterly drilling activity by commodity type, 2020-2021 IEA. All rights reserved. Sources: IEA analysis based on S&P Global. In March 2022 the price of nickel reached record levels and experienced highly volatile movement, causing the London Metal Exchange to temporarily close trade for the commodity. This was primarily driven by a short squeeze by market players, but recent 10 30 50 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 2021 Number of drills Cobalt Graphite Lithium Nickel Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 143 EV batteries and supply chains concerns about the supply of nickel from Russia due to its invasion of Ukraine has also fuelled price rises. Russia is the world’s largest producer of battery-grade (Class 1) nickel. Price increases are usually followed by expansion in supply with new mines or life extension of existing ones. Drilling activity is an indicator of exploration in the mining sector. Since battery metal commodity prices have begun to rise, so have drill counts (from 2020 to 2021, +50% for nickel and a threefold increase for lithium). High prices may therefore be a long-term benefit for future battery metals supply, stimulating significant supply investment to compensate for the underinvestment during the years of low commodity prices. Batteries have yet to experience the full impact of commodity price surges Despite the recent commodity price surge, battery prices still declined in 2021 with BNEF’s annual battery price survey recording a salesweighted average price of USD 132/kWh, a 6% decrease from 2020. Although this represents a significant reduction from the 13% decrease from 2019 to 2020, there are several factors that partially insulated the average battery price from the commodity price rises last year. First, the rising prices incentivised chemistry substitutions. Many automakers switched to lower cost cathode chemistries with less commodity price exposure, such as LFP, which saw a significant increase in adoption, over nickel-rich chemistries. Second, commodity prices were relatively low for the first half of 2021 which helped the average price decline. Third, the use of higher nickel chemistries such as NMC811 reduced the use of cobalt, the most expensive metal constituent in batteries per kilogramme (kg) (cobalt is around 5% of NMC811 cell price based on 2021 average price), also offsetting some costs, particularly in the first half of 2021. However, a key reason is the impact of rising commodity prices has yet to fully materialise. Automakers increasingly use contracts in which material costs are linked with commodity prices for high volume battery orders, though, there is a time lag. Therefore, these automakers did not feel the result of the exceptional commodity price rises from the last three months of 2021 until the first-quarter of 2022. If metal prices were to remain at levels experienced in the first three months of 2022 throughout the rest of the year, then we estimate that battery pack prices might increase by up to 15% from the 2021 weighted average price, all else being equal. The impact is likely to be mitigated by OEMs substituting other more cost-effective chemistries, but these price increases nonetheless will pose major challenges for automakers, increasing battery costs, decreasing manufacturer margins and raising costs for consumers.

All three metals are abundant in the earth’s crust, however, supply depends on mine production capacity. The exceptional rise in demand for batteries is now outstripping supply, with new mines not being built fast enough. Lithium Lithium demand has almost doubled since 2017 to 80 kt in 2021, of which demand for EV batteries accounts for 47%, up from 36% in 2020 and only 20% in 2017. Lithium is also used in the production of ceramics, glass and lubricants. Batteries are now the dominant driver of demand for lithium and therefore set the price. The availability of lithium supply is of particular concern because it is irreplaceable for Li-ion batteries and there are no commercial alternative battery chemistries available at scale today that meet the performance of Liion batteries. Alternative lithium-free chemistries, however, are making progress, for instance, with Na-ion being commercially introduced by CATL in 2021. Cobalt Cobalt demand was 170 kt in 2021, of which the EV battery share was 24%, up from 18% in 2020. Cobalt is also used in superalloys, hard metals and catalysts. The cobalt intensity of Li-ion batteries has decreased significantly over recent years as battery makers moved to higher nickel content chemistries to achieve higher energy densities and lower costs (cobalt is the most expensive constituent per kg of Li-ion battery metal). The additional concerns of human rights abuses and child labour related to cobalt mining in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have also motivated battery makers to move away from cobalt-intensive chemistries. Nickel Nickel demand is dominated by stainless steel production. Total demand was 2 640 kt in 2021, of which the share of EV-related demand was 7%, up from 4% in 2020. Batteries require Class 1 nickel (>99.8% purity), while Class 2 nickel (<99.8% purity) cannot be used without further significant processing. Nickel-based cathodes are the dominant EV battery chemistries today and are expected to remain so in the future due to the demand for longer driving range EVs particularly in Europe and the United States. There is almost seven times more nickel than lithium by weight in an NMC811 battery, therefore, EV Li-ion battery prices are most sensitive to nickel prices. This is of significant current concern given the war in Ukraine because Russia is the world’s largest supplier of Class 1 battery-grade nickel, producing around 20% of global supply.

Similar complex supply chains characterise other battery components such as electrolytes and separators. Cells are then fabricated and housed in modules within a battery pack which is integrated into the EV. To understand current trends and future prospects of EVs, it is critical to understand all of the stages in this complex supply chain. Mining The five key battery materials are lithium, nickel, cobalt, graphite and manganese.27 Lithium is extracted from two very different sources: brine or hard rock. Lithium brines are concentrated salt water containing high lithium contents and are typically located in the high elevation areas of Bolivia, Argentina and Chile in South America with Chile being the largest producer. Brine deposits often contain large quantities of other useful elements such as sodium, potassium, magnesium and boron which offsets some of the cost of pumping and processing brine. Lithium hard rock (spodumene) is primarily mined in Australia. Novel processes are being developed to extract lithium from unconventional resources such as geothermal brine. Currently, 27 The battery metals focused on for this analysis are lithium, nickel and cobalt. For analysis of other critical minerals, see IEA’s The Role of Critical Minerals in Clean Energy Transitions report. the top-five lithium suppliers account for about half of global lithium production. Major lithium suppliers include a mixture of large chemical and mining companies including: Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile SA (Chile); Pilbara Minerals (Australia); Allkem (Australia); Livent Corporation (United States); and Ganfeng Lithium Co. (China). Unlike for other battery metals, lithium extraction companies tend to be specialised in lithium mining and chemical companies. Nickel is found primarily in two types of deposit – sulphide and laterite. Sulphide deposits are mainly located in Russia, Canada and Australia and tend to contain higher grade nickel. It is more easily processed into Class 1 battery-grade nickel. Laterite, however, tends to contain lower grade nickel and is mainly found in Indonesia, Philippines and New Caledonia. Laterite requires additional energy intensive processing to become battery-grade nickel. Nickel production is less concentrated than lithium with about nine companies supplying half of global nickel production. Key nickel suppliers include: Jinchuan Group (China); BHP Group (Australia); Vale SA (Brazil); Tsingshan (China); Nickel Asia Corporation (Philippines); and Glencore (Switzerland). Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 149 EV batteries and supply chains Cobalt is predominantly mined as a by-product of copper or nickel mining. Over 70% of cobalt is produced in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Glencore (Switzerland) is the largest global producer. Other key cobalt suppliers include: Jinchuan Group (China); CN Molybdenum (China); and Chemaf (DRC). Artisanal and small-scale mining is responsible for 10 – 20% of cobalt production in the DRC. Graphite is the dominant anode material and can be found naturally or produced synthetically. Natural graphite mining is dominated by China (80%), though global production is becoming more diversified, with many greenfield graphite mining projects being developed including in Tanzania, Mozambique, Canada and Madagascar. Manganese resources are more widely distributed around the world than the other battery metals and remain available at relatively low cost. There is a general expectation that there will not be an ore shortage in the near term. The leading producers of manganese ore include South Africa, Australia, Gabon and China. Raw material processing Batteries require high purity materials and therefore high-grade sources, as well as significant refining, is required to reach sufficient quality battery chemical precursors. These refining processes typically involve heavy industrial processes based on heat or chemical treatment (typically pyrometallurgy and/or hydrometallurgy) to refine the raw ore into the usual required chemicals, lithium carbonate or hydroxide, or cobalt and nickel sulphate. Adding complexity, certain raw materials are more or only suitable for the production of battery precursors. For instance, lithium carbonate is produced from lithium brine, which is useful for wider lithium demand, however, unsuitable for use in leading high-nickel Li-ion batteries. Lithium hydroxide is more suitable for high-nickel chemistries and is more easily produced from spodumene hard rock sources. Similarly, battery production typically requires nickel sulphate, typically only synthesised from Class 1 nickel, which is most economically produced from nickel sulphides. Class 2 nickel can be processed into Class 1 nickel"}

Similarly, battery production typically requires nickel sulphate, typically only synthesised from Class 1 nickel, which is most economically produced from nickel sulphides. Class 2 nickel can be processed into Class 1 nickel but requires significant additional processing. New processing technologies, however, are increasing the flexibility of nickel processing routes. These include: • High-pressure acid leaching (HPAL) is a process which is able to produce Class 1 nickel from lower grade laterite resources. • Mixed hydroxide precipitate (MHP), an intermediate product in nickel refining, can be further be refined into nickel sulphates at low cost from laterite resources. • Nickel matte (a battery-grade nickel precursor) can be produced from laterite resources, but is more emissionsintensive than conventional production routes. Raw material processing is highly concentrated. For example, in lithium carbonate and hydroxide production, five major companies Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 150 EV batteries and supply chains are responsible for three-quarters of global production capacity. Often the refining is done by the mining company together with the extraction. For example, Ganfeng, a Chinese mining company, has evolved to include processing and refining lithium and is increasingly focussed on boosting their lithium hydroxide production. In other cases, it is exported to third parties to do the refining, with many processing companies in China, such as Chengxin Lithium Group or Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt. This is particularly the case for Australian spodumene as almost no miners yet produce integrated lithium chemical supply. While manganese resources are widely distributed, production of high-purity manganese sulphate raises concerns around geographical concentration of supply. China currently accounts for around 90% of the global production capacity, raising the need for new, diversified manganese refining capacity. New manganese sulphate projects are starting to come online in Australia, Europe, Indonesia and United States. Cell component production Batteries are comprised of several highly specialised components including cathode and anode materials, electrolytes and separators. These components require advanced materials chemistry and engineering for their production. The most complex processing is required to form the battery active materials from the high purity chemicals produced from raw material processing, such as lithium hydroxide and nickel sulphate. These materials are further processed using specialised syntheses to produce active materials for the cathode and anode. The leading cathode active materials for Li-ion are transition metal oxides including lithium cobalt oxide, lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC), lithium nickel cobalt aluminium oxide (NCA) and lithium iron phosphate (LFP). Seven companies are responsible for 55% of global cathode material production capacity. Key players include: Sumitomo (Japan); Tianjin B&M Science and Technology (China); Shenzhen Dynanonic (China); and Ningbo Shanshan (China). The dominant anode active material is graphite which can be natural or synthetic. Producing graphite anode materials is more mature and established than cathode material production given graphite has been the dominant anode for a long time, though both graphite types require sophisticated processing. Flake natural graphite is used in batteries and is processed into spherical graphite to be more homogenous for use as anode material. Synthetic graphite is produced from refining hydrocarbon materials such as coke. To improve graphite anode performance, small and increasing fractions of silicon are being added to the graphite anode to increase energy density. Anode material production is even more highly concentrated with four companies responsible for half of global production capacity. The largest players include: Ningbo Shanshan (China); BTR New Energy Materials (China); and Shanghai Putailai New Energy Technology (China). The top-six companies are all Chinese and account for two-thirds of global production capacity. Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 151 EV batteries and supply chains Separators are engineered microporous membranes, typically made of polyethylene or polypropylene and often ceramic coated for improved safety for EVs. Separator production is also concentrated with five companies responsible for half of the global production capacity.

Most companies that engage in cell component manufacturing are highly specialised and only produce those components. Battery cell and pack production Producing the battery cells is a multi-step process with two broad stages: electrode manufacturing and cell fabrication. Though cell manufacturers have different cells designs, the cell manufacturing processes are similar, use mature technologies and are well established. These processes are energy intensive, being conducted in highly controlled clean and dry room conditions to avoid any impurities and moisture. Using low-carbon sources of electricity is key to reducing emissions in cell production. First electrodes are produced by mixing cathode or anode active materials with a binder, solvent and additives before coating on aluminium (cathode) or copper (anode) foil current collectors. The electrodes are rolled (calendared) and subsequently dried. The cell is then created by stacking the electrodes with a separator in between. Manufacture of the battery pack may be completed either by the cell manufacturer or by the automaker. Cells are first housed together in module frames, then the battery pack is assembled through integration of modules, the battery management system, electronics and sensors, all encased in a final housing structure. Battery cell production is a capital-intensive process and production is highly concentrated, with the top-three producers in 2021, CATL (China), LG Energy Solution (Korea), and Panasonic (Japan), accounting for 65% of global production. Cell manufacturers from Japan and Korea tend to be established conglomerates having decades of experience making batteries for consumer electronics. There are also Chinese companies that began producing batteries for consumer electronics in the 1990s and then specialised in batteries for EVs such as CATL and BYD. A third wave of new battery makers is taking shape in Europe and North America, but today they are mostly in planning or upscaling stages. With recent supply chain strains many battery and automakers are becoming increasingly involved in the mining and processing of critical minerals to ensure access to production; Tesla, CATL and LG Energy Solution have all become directly involved in upstream stages. Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 152 EV batteries and supply chains EV production The battery pack is integrated into the EV by the automakers, where it is connected with the electric motor, on-board charge module, high voltage distribution box, electric transmission and thermal systems, depending on the vehicle architecture. Automakers focussing only on EVs must develop greenfield factories, while for incumbent automakers pre-existing vehicle assembly factories can be retooled and repurposed for EV production. EV manufacturing is currently concentrated in a small number of OEMs, with the top-six companies responsible for 52% of production in 2021. This is a slight decrease from 2020 where the top-six were responsible for 55%. The three largest producers, Tesla (United States), VW Group (Germany) and BYD (China), accounted for a third of EV production in 2021. The rapid growth of BYD has been particularly impressive, it was not even among the top-six producers in 2020, but ranked as the third-largest producer of EVs in 2021. Re-use Re-use or repurposing involves refurbishing EV batteries for less demanding second-life applications, typically in stationary storage. Spent EV batteries typically still have around 80% of their usable capacity, therefore, repurposing generates additional value from these batteries. Re-use requires disassembly of the pack, testing of the module/cells, and repackaging into new packs for new applications. The primary drivers of cost of refurbishing batteries are the logistics involved in their collection, testing of remaining useful life, and the physical disassembly and repacking of cells/packs. Reuse, however, faces economic and regulatory challenges including ensuring reliable grading of cells/packs, liability and ensuring the cost of repurposing is competitive with new batteries. Recycling There are three primary methods for Li-ion battery recycling: pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy and direct recycling. Pyrometallurgy involves smelting the battery in a high temperature oven, recovering only a fraction of metals from the cathode. Hydrometallurgy involves a chemical leaching process to precipitate out individual metals. Currently, most battery recycling uses a combination of pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy as they are well suited to a poorly sorted feedstock of cells. These methods rely on reclaiming the expensive metals specifically nickel and cobalt, and often the copper and aluminium. Current global capacity for battery recycling is around 200 kt/year with China accounting for about half. This dominant position is expected to be retained due to announced additional capacity. Most battery recycling companies are independent recyclers, but OEMs, battery"}

Most battery recycling companies are independent recyclers, but OEMs, battery manufacturers, miners and processors are starting to enter the market. Direct recycling is an emerging process, offering improved recycling efficiency, as it does not break down the cathode into elements, but instead retains the material crystal structure and regenerates the cathode material. This retains the embedded energy and economic Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 153 EV batteries and supply chains value in cathode processing, avoiding the need to resynthesise from raw materials. It is well suited to cathodes containing little valuable metals such as LFP. However, it is limited by its inflexibility as it must be tailored to each cathode chemistry, and recovered cathodes can only be input into production of the same battery type. Though, new processing methods are under development to convert recycled chemistries into current chemistries e.g., NMC333 to NMC811. Policy mandates, for instance, extended producer responsibility for battery recycling, are spurring the formation of joint ventures among OEMs, re-use and recycling companies. For instance, SK Innovation and Kia are developing both re-use and recycling initiatives; Kia evaluates used batteries and repackages ones suitable for re-use in stationary storage and the rest are sent to SK Innovation’s recycling process for material recovery. Renault, Veolia and Solvay have formed a consortium for the same purpose. BMW, Umicore and Northvolt have also formed a consortium to create a closed-loop for battery cells, involving both re-use and recycling.

The United States has a smaller role in the global EV battery supply chain, with only 10% of EV production and 7% of battery production capacity. Both Korea and Japan have considerable shares of the supply chain downstream of raw material processing, particularly in cathode and anode material production. Korea is responsible for 15% of cathode, and 3% of anode material production capacity while Japan accounts for 14% and 11%, respectively. In terms of raw material supply and extraction, battery metals are highly concentrated geographically and thus are relatively more vulnerable to supply shocks and constraints. More than half of the world’s lithium is produced in Australia while 70% of the world’s cobalt is produced in the DRC. Nickel supply is slightly more diverse; Indonesia has the largest share of production with almost 40% of total nickel supply, yet today little of it is used in the EV battery supply chain as it mostly produces Class 2 nickel. Not only is Russia the world’s third-largest producer of nickel, more significantly, it is the world’s largest producer of Class 1 battery-grade nickel with around 20% of the global supply. The geographical distribution of mineral extraction is unlikely to shift significantly in the near term given today’s project pipeline. However, when comparing current mining production to mineral reserves (reserves refer to the resources which could be economically extracted at the time of determination), there appears to be significant unrealised potential for diversification of extraction in the longer term. In particular, Australia, already the largest lithium producer, holds the joint largest reserves of nickel, alongside Indonesia, with 22% of global reserves. However, Australia is producing only 6% of current global production. Australia also has the second-largest reserves of cobalt with almost 20%, while accounting for a mere 3% of current production. There is also significant potential to diversify natural graphite production with Europe holding the world’s largest share with over a quarter of global reserves, primarily in Turkey. Brazil has significant Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 157 EV batteries and supply chains potential for graphite and nickel, with 22% and 17% of global reserves, respectively. Nevertheless, there are several caveats which must be considered with reserves such as resource quality, particularly important for battery metals, investment and aboveground constraints which may limit potential as a reliable source of future supply. There is a need for updated and improved geological surveys in emerging market and developing economies. Resource surveys in many low income countries were conducted long ago when battery metals were not in focus. An example is the East African Nickel Belt where the US Geological Survey indicates limited Africa nickel reserve numbers. However, in 2021, BHP struck a deal to invest USD 100 million in the Kabanga Nickel project in Tanzania, reporting it as one of the world’s largest nickel sulphide deposits. Similarly, Bolivia has abundant identified lithium resources, yet no reported reserves. This highlights the potential that updated geological surveys can bring in today’s market context. On the other hand, the downstream supply chain distribution is set to change this decade, particularly for batteries. If current policies, announcements and investments are realised, by the end of this decade a quarter of battery production capacity will be located in Europe and the United States. Similarly, there have been recent announcements related to cathode materials production in Europe and the United States. For example, Volkswagen announced a new partnership with Umicore that aims to build cathode material production capacity in Europe. Redwood Materials and L&F aim to build a US factory producing cathode material for 5 million EVs per year by 2030, with similar plans for Europe. Northvolt, the European cell manufacturer, intends to produce over 100 GWh per year of its own cathode material. Anode material production is likely to continue to be dominated by China as it holds the entire supply chain from mining through to anode material production. In addition, almost all of the top-ten anode material production companies are Chinese, which makes new anode production overseas largely dependent on foreign investment by these companies. Moreover, graphite anode material prices are not high enough to significantly incentivise new production capacity. Although there are exceptions, such as Nouveau Monde Graphite which is constructing both a graphite mine and graphite anode active material plant in Canada.

Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 158 EV batteries and supply chains Impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on battery supply chains Lithium, cobalt and graphite supply chains are less affected by the supply disruption caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as relatively little supply and processing is from either country. However, there is concern regarding nickel; Russia is the thirdlargest producer, supplying about 9% and processing about 6% of global nickel in 2021. Though, more critically, Russia is the world’s largest Class 1 nickel supplier, producing about 20% of the world’s Class 1 battery-grade nickel, most of which is supplied by Norilsk Nickel. Recent concerns for the supply of nickel from Russia, coupled with financial speculation by the founder of Tsingshan, a major Chinese steel producer, pushed nickel prices to an unprecedented level of USD 100 000 per tonne (the average price in 2021 was USD 18 500 per tonne), resulting in the London Metal Exchange temporarily closing nickel trade. Much of the exceptional price rise was due to a short squeeze, however, there was an underlying increase in price driven by Russian supply concerns in an already tight supply market. Trading resumed and the nickel price stabilised at around USD 33 000 per tonne, still exceptionally high. Nevertheless, significant concerns for nickel supply from Russia remain, which will likely keep prices high. Nickel supply from Russia is a key source for the developing EV battery supply chain in Europe. BASF (Germany) is building a major cathode material precursor plant in Finland and already has a long-term nickel supply agreement with Norilsk Nickel. It is possible that Australia and Canada could fill the gap of supply from Russia for nickel sulphate in Europe, as well as Indonesia once HPAL projects are operational, though Europe will also be competing with North American demand.

Major automotive manufacturing countries aim to extend their reach up the supply chain from making EV components and automobiles, to also securing stable upstream supply and refining capacity of minerals and metals Some countries have identified battery and EV manufacturing to be strategic sectors and look to support domestic production. Some explicitly target investment in the sector to “future proof” economies, build a workforce to underpin a low-carbon future and secure a position to be a market leader in the high value-added steps in the burgeoning EV market. China’s rise to the largest share of global EV battery production capacity in the world (77%) is a direct result of over a decade of government policies that support the industry. Korea, which accounts for 5% of global production capacity, along with Japan, at 4%, have recently launched large funding packages to bolster the competitiveness of their battery and EV industries. While the European Union has been investing significantly over the last few years in R&D and manufacturing capacity, it will likely take time to develop the supply chains needed for an EU battery production industry. Similarly, the United States recently renewed its focus on building domestic battery and EV supply chains, particularly leveraging its critical minerals supply and automotive sectors. Other new entrants such as Indonesia and Thailand are putting a strategic focus on battery and EV production. They aim to become regional market leaders by leveraging their geographic proximity to Asian market leaders as well as upstream mineral and metal supplies. Indonesia and Thailand are attracting investments from major battery and EV manufacturers such as Great Wall Motors, Foxconn, LG Group and CATL.

In April 2022, the federal government and provincial government of Ontario announced a CAD 518 million (USD 398 million) package to supplement General Motor of Canada’s existing CAD 2.3 billion (USD 1.8 billion) investment in upgrading facilities in Ontario, which includes retooling facilities to produce EVs. In addition, Ontario received its largest automotive industry investment in history of CAD 5 billion (USD 4 billion) with a joint venture between LG Energy Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 161 EV batteries and supply chains Solution Ltd. and Stellantis N.V. to produce EV batteries with a production capacity of 45 GWh. The governments worked closely to foster this investment, such as providing favourable electricity prices and provincial and federal subsidies (which are being negotiated). China • Share of global EV battery production capacity: 76%. • EV battery production capacity in 2021: 655 GWh. China's leading role in EV battery production capacity is a direct result of more than a decade of policies that prioritise the development of an integrated domestic supply chain. China has long viewed batteries as a strategic industrial sector. Released in mid-2021, China’s 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) focusses on “strategic emerging industries”, which includes new energy vehicles (NEVs). It provides guidance for state and local governments to develop plans, including a focus on higher quality and standards for NEV manufacturing, as well as focussed R&D efforts for next-generation battery chemistries. Of particular note, are plans to promote the development of the Na-ion battery industry during the 2021-25 period, using industry and product standards to achieve scale, lower cost and improved battery performance. Regional five-year plans (e.g. Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Tianjin, Jiangsu, Fujian and Shaanxi) focus on integrating NEV production with related industies (i.e., battery manufacturing and recycling systems) in collaboration with large industrial EV car, component and battery manufacturers. They aim to bolster NEV production in industrial development zones through incentives such as tax exemptions, preferable loans and co-financing, and to develop industrial production bases. Also released in mid-2021, China’s 14th Five-Year Plan for Circular Economy Development (2021-2025) aims to standardise management of resources from the battery recycling industry, as well as to introduce both NEV battery traceability and battery recycling traceability management systems. Administrative measures for the re-use of NEV batteries released in August 2021 aim to standardise and further develop the industry by requiring battery re-use enterprises to be responsible for managing the whole life cycle of reused product design and production, packaging, transportation and recycling of the batteries, ensure product quality, product certification and environmentally responsible disposal. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in November 2021 released two draft guidelines for comment on the development of the Li-ion battery industry in order to strengthen management of the sector. The guidelines propose plant expansions to only occur if production can be assured to exceed 50% of capacity, technical standards on minimum energy density (no less than 180 Watthours per kilogramme), cycle life and the encouragement of the use of solar power in the manufacturing process. In January 2022, Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 162 EV batteries and supply chains technical specifications for pollution control and treatment for waste Li-ion batteries was implemented (for a trial period). European Union • Share of global EV battery production capacity: 7%. • EV battery production capacity in 2021: 60 GWh. The European Union has a strategic focus on the development of domestic battery supply chains. In March 2022, the European Battery Alliance and the US Li-Bridge Alliance announced a collaboration to accelerate the development of Li-ion and next-generation batteries, including critical raw materials. The Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI) is a key strategic instrument with regard to the implementation of the European Union Industrial Strategy. A two-part IPCEI has been implemented to promote battery production: the IPCEI on Batteries and the IPCEI European Battery Innovation (EuBatIn).

The European Commission proposed revisions to the EU Battery Directive to elevate it to a regulation as part of actions taken for the Green New Deal in late 2020. They introduce mandatory carbon footprint declarations for batteries sold in Europe, along with minimum requirements for recycled content and requirements for collection and recycling of automotive EV batteries. As of March 2022, the latest update indicates the European Parliament has reached a consensus on the proposed revisions with a few amendments. Of note, this includes the addition of a new battery category, “light means of transport” (e.g. electric bicycles) and minimum targets for recovered cobalt, lead, lithium or nickel from waste. The proposals are to be discussed with the member states in the Council of the European Union. The Batt4EU Partnership was launched in June 2021 to combine efforts of the European Commission and members of the Batteries European Partnership Association, which includes industry and R&D stakeholders within the battery supply chain. The partnership will fund battery R&D and innovation projects within the framework of the Horizon Europe Programme. A MoU was signed between the two parties stating that the European Commission will direct up to EUR 925 million (USD 1 billion) in funding between 2021 and 2027 for battery research and innovation. Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 163 EV batteries and supply chains In February 2022, the European Commission granted EIT InnoEnergy EUR 10 million (USD 11.8 million) towards the European Battery Alliance Academy to help bridge a growing skills gap for the work force across the European battery value chain. In France, a EUR 30 billion (USD 35 billion) overall investment plan was presented in 2021. It provides for up to EUR 4 billion (USD 4.7 billion) to support the automotive industry to produce 2 million EVs by 2030. In Germany, EUR 1 billion (USD 1.2 billion) in funding through 2022 was allocated by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action to establish the country as a global leader in battery cell production. India • Share of global EV battery production capacity: 0%. • EV battery production capacity in 2021: 0 GWh. India’s Production Linked Incentives scheme has a strategic focus on advanced automotive technology and components (including EV) and advanced chemistry cell battery (ACC) sectors. The automotive and auto components sector was allocated close to INR 259 billion (USD 3.5 billion). With an aim to build capacity of 50 GWh, the ACC sector was allocated INR 181 billion (USD 243 million). Subsidies are to be provided over a span of five years based on performance metrics such as energy density (ACC only), battery cycle life (ACC only) and number of units sold or components manufactured in India. A request for proposals was launched in January 2022 for both schemes, with the government to award contracts by March 2022. For the ACC scheme, bids totalled 130 GWh, close to three times the amount of the manufacturing capacity to be awarded . A total of 95 applicants were approved. Final recipients include both large auto manufacturers and OEMs as well as small and medium enterprises in the industry. For the advanced automotive technology and auto components scheme applications totalled a proposed INR 450 billion (USD 6.1 billion) for all vehicle categories, and were submitted by both incumbant automotive OEMs and new market entrants. Japan • Share of global EV battery production capacity: 4%. • EV battery production capacity in 2021: 36 GWh.

The mid-2021 announcement of the K-battery blueprint renews government focus on expanding tax incentives and R&D spending. The stated ambition is for Korea to be the number one EV battery manufacturing country in the world by 2030. The formation of a “grand-alliance” between the top-three Korean (and global) domestic battery manufacturers (LG Energy Solution, Samsung SDI and SK Innovation) aims to build an industrial network. A fund of KRW 80 billion (USD 69 million) will be established, with contributions from the government, companies and financial institutions, to support battery technology, parts and materials development in collaboration with other companies and academia. An additional KRW 1.5 trillion (USD 1.3 billion) will be made available to support battery development in Korea through tax incentives, R&D and capital investments. United States • Share of global EV battery production capacity: 7%. • EV battery production capacity in 2021: 57 GWh. An executive order in early 2021 mandated a thorough assessment of US supply chains. This includes the identification of risks in highcapacity battery supply chains. With this focus on battery supply chains came a host of strategic policy announcements and blueprints. One included the release of the National Blueprint for Lithium Batteries (2021-2030), which elaborates a vision to establish secure battery materials and technology supply chains within the country. It aims to set guidance for policy makers, industry and investors for the long term by creating goals across the entire supply chain. These include: securing upstream raw and critical minerals and materials processing base; creating domestic electrode, cell and pack manufacturing sectors; end-of-life critical material recycling; and R&D efforts on battery technology development. In October 2021, the US Department of Energy Argonne National Laboratory announced the creation of Li-Bridge. It is a new publicprivate partnership to bridge gaps in the domestic lithium battery supply chain. It marks the first collaboarion of its kind in the US battery industry. Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 165 EV batteries and supply chains In June 2021, USD 60 million was awarded for 24 projects to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars and light/heavy trucks. This includes projects to accelerate innovation for EV batteries, electric drive systems and new mobility system technologies (automated, connected, electric and shared vehicles). The government approved close to USD 3 billion to boost production of advanced battery supply chains in February 2022 under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Bipartisan Infrastructure Law). This includes funding for upstream battery materials and refining as well as for production plants, battery cell and pack manufacturing facilities and recycling facilities. Southeast Asia • Share of global EV battery production capacity: 1.0%. • EV battery production capacity in 2021: 8.7 GWh. Thailand, which has one of the largest automotive production centres in Southeast Asia, released guidelines to promote EVs and states its ambition to have 30% of all cars produced domestically to be EVs in 2030. Recent statements by government officials signal an intent to strive for 100% ZEV sales by 2035. Thailand’s Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) is providing incentives for strategic manufacturing companies (including EVs) such as corporate tax breaks, infrastructure development and low interest loans. This spurred deals for EV and battery production facilities, such as with Chinese automaker Great Wall Motors in June 2021 and a USD 1 billion 8 GWh battery production plant both in the Rayong EEC. PTT, the state-owned oil and gas group, signed a joint venture deal with Foxconn to make EVs starting in 2024 with a capacity of 50 000 electric cars per year and targeted to expand to 150 000 by 2030. Indonesia has a production target of 600 000 electric LDVs and 2.45 million electric two-wheelers by 2030. It aims to leverage its large raw nickel ore reserves upstream while offering incentives further downstream for EV component producers and manufacturers.

Indonesia has a production target of 600 000 electric LDVs and 2.45 million electric two-wheelers by 2030. It aims to leverage its large raw nickel ore reserves upstream while offering incentives further downstream for EV component producers and manufacturers. This follows on from the Presidential Regulation to prioritise domestic EV production. It aims to ensure a certain percentage of Indonesian sourced EV components and nickel are used in EV production. The Indonesia Battery Corporation, a state-owned battery manufacturer, was formed in March 2021 by the Ministry of StateOwned Enterprises and four other state-owned entities. The investment needed for this holding is Indonesian rupiah (IDR) 238 trillion (USD 17 billion). The corporation’s production target is up to 140 GWh of battery cells by 2030, of which 50 GWh will be for export. For context, current global battery production capacity is about 871 GWh. A memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed in July 2021 for an EV battery factory between the Ministry of Investment and Hyundai Motor Company with a capacity of 10 GWh, with a price tag Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 166 EV batteries and supply chains of USD 1.1 billion. The factory, to be built with Korean LG Group, aims to incorporate battery precursor production with pack production, as well as mining, smelting and recycling facilities. This deal is a part of a larger MoU signed by Indonesia’s government and a consortium led by the LG Group for USD 9.8 billion to develop integrated EV supply chains. The consortium signed a non-binding agreement with PT Aneka Tambang Tbk, the state-owned mining company, and Indonesia Battery Corporation. Gogoro (known for battery swapping) to facilitate battery manufacturing, and the development of EV supportive industries such as energy storage systems and battery recycling. This include Foxconn’s production of solid-state and lithium iron phosphate batteries. Other potential deals include a USD 5 billion lithium battery plant with projected production in 2024 between China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) and Indonesia’s PT Aneka Tambang. In early 2022, Foxconn signed a MoU with the Indonesia’s Ministry of Investment and Chinese Taipei’s electric scooter manufacturer Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 167 EV batteries and supply chains Harmonised technical regulations for the safe and sustainable deployment of EVs In addition to policies, financial incentives and market penetration targets, technical regulations have an essential role to ensure the safe and sustainable deployment of EVs. The World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations (WP.29), hosted by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, develops legally binding regulations covering technical requirements to improve vehicle safety and lower environmental impacts. UN Regulation No. 100 / UN GTR No. 20 on Electric Vehicle Safety prescribes testing procedures to ensure EVs are safe for use. It details methodologies to test EVs and protect users from electrical shocks, ensure fire, water, vibration and mechanical resistance of key EV components, among other safety tests. UN GTR No.22 on In-Vehicle Battery Durability was adopted in March 2022 and prescribes minimum performance requirements for the durability of batteries in electrified vehicles. It requires manufacturers to certify that the batteries fitted in their EVs will lose less than 20% of initial capacity over five years or 100 000 km and less than 30% over eight years or 160 000 kms. The durability standard aims to prevent the use of low quality batteries and to ensure that only durable batteries are installed in EVs. This is crucial to increase consumer trust and to improve the environmental performance of EVs beyond their low emissions output. Making sure each battery lasts longer would help to ease the pressure on demand for critical raw materials needed for their production and reduce waste from used batteries. Similar provisions are now being developed for heavy-duty electric vehicles (e-buses and e-trucks). The battery durability standard was adopted by many countries/regions that committed to transpose it into their national legislation. They are Australia, Canada, China, European Union, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Norway, Russian Federation, South Africa, Tunisia, United Kingdom and United States. In the European Union, the provisions are expected to be part of the forthcoming Euro 7/VII legislation.

Australia Australia is the largest producer of lithium in the world and one of the top producers of nickel globally. In September 2021, the government released an AUD 1.3 billion (USD 980 million) loan facility for Australian critical minerals targeted for advanced sectors including EV battery production. In addition, a AUD 2 billion (USD 1.5 billion) fund was announced to increase critical mineral processing capacity, including for battery minerals and metals. In December 2021, the federal government awarded “Major Project Status” to a AUD 2.4 billion (USD 1.8 billion) battery minerals complex in New South Wales for a nickel and cobalt mine, materials processing and recycling facility. Having major project status allows access to additional financial support, co-ordination and streamlined regulatory approvals. The facility is planned to be powered almost entirely by renewables, making it one of the world’s largest battery metal producers operating on renewable energy. Canada To implement its Critical Minerals Strategy, the government allocated CAD 3.8 billion (USD 2.9 billion) over eight years in the 2022 budget – the first budget announcement of its kind. Of this, around CAD 1.5 billion (USD 1.2 billion) is for infrastructure investment to support critical mineral supply chains, CAD 79.2 million (USD 60.9 million) is for integrated data sets for critical mineral exploration and development, and a new 30% tax credit for critical mineral exploration. Chile Chile remains one of the largest producers of lithium in the world, though there has been slow growth in developing new projects. To counter this trend, in October 2021 the government launched a special auction for operating contracts to explore and produce 400 000 tonnes of lithium. Divided into five tranches of 80 000 tonnes each, it provides successful bidders a period of seven years to conduct geological exploration, studies and 20 years for production. The government will take a royalty payment, plus a variable payment during production. Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 169 EV batteries and supply chains China China continues to dominate in the mid- to downstream EV battery supply chain, though it currently owns less than 25% of upstream mining capacity. The 14th Five-Year Plan for the Development of the Raw Materials Industry (2021-2025) was released in December 2021. It aims to focus technological innovation in key materials for development, including promoting the R&D of new, more efficient and environmentally-sensitive mining technologies and minerals, including salt lake lithium. The plan also aims to develop “urban mines” to support large-scale recovery of lithium, nickel, cobalt and tungsten at recycling bases and industrial clusters. European Union Formed in 2020, the European Raw Materials Alliance (ERMA) was created as a part of the EU’s Action Plan on Critical Raw Materials. Along with working on regulatory bottlenecks and stakeholder engagement, its focus is to act as a pipeline to catalyse investment for projects. ERMA has announced plans to launch a raw materials investment fund planned for 2022 In November 2021, the European Parliament voted in the Critical Raw Materials Strategy with a focus on “open strategic autonomy”, i.e. access to alternatives and competition when sourcing critical raw materials. Other aspects include sourcing critical raw materials from within the European Union member states, increased recycling and circular use of resources, and investment in refining and separation capacities (including lithium). The European Parliament has asked the European Commission and member states to create an IPCEI on critical raw materials to focus on reducing criticality and dependence. Indonesia Indonesia is the largest nickel producer in the world. It aims to maintain that position as a key supplier for the EV battery manufacturing sector. In 2020, Indonesia imposed a nickel ore export ban. This was followed in 2021 with consideration of imposition of a tax on the export of nickel products that contain less than 70% nickel content in an attempt to further develop domestic refining capacity. Today, most nickel products contain between 30-40% nickel and are generally exported to be further refined to have higher purity nickel products (70% or above) and could thus significantly impact exports. United States In March 2022, the United States invoked the Defence Production Act to rapidly boost US production of critical minerals for EV and storage batteries, focussing on lithium, nickel, cobalt, graphite and manganese.

The fund focusses on commercial-ready technologies that are either net zero or net negative emissions for critical minerals needed for the clean energy transition. In April 2021, 13 critical mineral projects were selected to receive a total of USD 19 million. The fund focuses on projects that would help transition fossil fuel producing communities towards clean energy jobs, including increased recycling from critical mineral resources and waste streams, critical mineral and metal extraction from fossil fuel products and their waste streams for use in various applications including EV batteries. In February 2022, the US departments of Energy, Defense and State signed a Memorandum of Agreement to support stockpiling of critical minerals that would facilitate the transition to clean energy, in particular for batteries and wind turbines, and to meet national security needs.

While for most components, EVs are not too different from conventional vehicles, batteries rely on distinct and critical materials dependent supply chains which must dramatically scale up this decade to meet projected demand. Most supply chain components can be scaled up rapidly; battery production factories can be built in under two years and the project pipeline is very large. On the other hand, raw material extraction requires investment long before production reaches scale. Planned battery factories can meet 2030 demand In the Stated Policies Scenario, battery demand from EVs increases in 2030 to 2.2 TWh and to 3.5 TWh in the Announced Pledges Scenario. This is a more than sixfold increase from the production level in 2021 for the Stated Policies Scenario and a ten-fold increase for the Announced Pledges Scenario. Achieving such production levels requires the manufacture of an additional 52 gigafactories of 35 GWh annual production capacity in the Stated Policies Scenario and 90 gigafactories in the Announced Pledges Scenario. Battery demand is driven by electric cars which account for 85% of the projected total by 2030 in both scenarios. Not only will electric car sales increase, but current trends and new model announcements suggest that vehicles will have increasingly higher battery capacity due to demand for longer driving ranges and larger vehicles. This trend contributes to around a third of the rise in battery demand and is especially pronounced in North America. China is projected to have the largest battery demand, though its global share shrinks from 60% in 2021 to 40% in 2030 in the Stated Policies Scenario and 25% in the Announced Pledges Scenario. The United States undergoes the fastest battery demand increase among major markets driven by rapid EV deployment as well as the largest battery capacity per vehicle, increasing share slightly in the Stated Policies Scenario with around 15% in 2030 from 11% in 2021 and increasing to above 20% in the Announced Pledges Scenario in 2030. The share of global EV battery demand is also projected to decrease in Europe from 25% in 2021 to 20% in both the Stated Policies and Announced Pledges Scenarios in 2030.

According to recent accounting by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, the announced battery production capacity by private companies for EVs in 2030 amounts to 4.6 TWh, a higher value than for both the Stated Policies Scenario and Announced Pledges Scenario demand. If all the announced capacity successfully came online by 2030, using total battery demand, the utilisation factor of battery manufacturing would be 47% in the Stated Policies Scenario, slightly higher than in 2021 (43% based on nameplate capacity). Battery production capacity will still be concentrated in China (70%), yet more Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 174 EV batteries and supply chains investments are being directed to other regions, with a quarter of battery production capacity expected in Europe and the United States by 2030. Anode and cathode production is slowly becoming more geographically diversified Scaling up cell and battery production will require additional output from anode and cathode manufacturers. In the Stated Policies Scenario, there is a sixfold increase in cathode demand and a fivefold increase in anode demand in 2030 relative to 2021 production. For the Announced Pledges Scenario, cathode demand increases tenfold and anode demand eightfold. In the Stated Policies Scenario, cathode production reaches 3 300 kt and anode production 1 500 kt in 2030, requiring around 29 additional cathode material plants and 23 additional anode material plants. For the Announced Pledges Scenario, cathode demand is 5 200 kt and anode is 2 500 kt, requiring about 50 cathode and 40 anode plants. For each GWh of battery production, 1.5 kt of cathode and 0.9 kt of anode material are required. Current cathode and anode material production are highly concentrated; together China, Japan and Korea account for 97% of current cathode and and 99% of anode production. Looking forward, the picture does not change much in the near term. Assessing all current announced and under construction cathode and anode material production plants, which are set to be online by 2025, shows the United States and Europe together will only produce around 4% of cathode material and 2% of anode material in 2025. Increased diversification is expected in the longer term based on announcements of planned production in Europe and North America. For example, by BASF with a planned cathode material production plant in Canada.

Therefore, it experiences the fastest demand growth of the battery metals. Practically, all of the increase in demand for lithium to 2030 is projected to come from EV batteries in both scenarios. Lithium demand in the Stated Policies Scenario reaches about 330 kt by 2030, a fourfold increase relative to 2021 production (80 kt). For the Announced Pledges Scenario, lithium demand reaches 500 kt, a sixfold increase from 2021 driven by higher EV sales across all modes. EV batteries were responsible for almost half of global lithium demand in 2021. In 2030 this rises to 70% in the Stated Policies Scenario and almost 80% in the Announced Pledges Scenario. In order to meet this surge in lithium demand, around 30 new lithium mines are needed in the Stated Policies Scenario by 2030 and 50 new lithium mines in the Announced Pledges Scenario, assuming an average annual lithium mine production capacity of 8 kt. By 2030, nickel is facing the largest absolute demand increase as high-nickel chemistries are the current dominant cathode for EVs, and are expected to remain so. High-nickel Li-ion batteries require far more nickel than even lithium. For example, a NMC811 battery requires almost seven times more nickel than lithium by weight. For cobalt, the opposite is true as battery makers continue to move to lower cobalt content chemistries (and even cobalt-free chemistries by 2030) to reduce costs and due to environmental, social and governance concerns. However, the surge in global demand for EV batteries still increases total cobalt demand this decade.

Out of total demand for nickel, EV batteries account for a fifth of demand in 2030 and about a quarter of demand for cobalt in the Stated Policies Scenario. In the Announced Pledges Scenario, nickel and cobalt demand from EV batteries is 65% higher than in the Stated Policies Scenario, with an EV share of 30% and 40%, respectively. To meet the projected demand in 2030 in the Stated Policies Scenario, 41 nickel and 11 cobalt additional mines are needed – a significant scaling up requirement.

Elements of the supply chains have various lead times. The downstream stage, EV vehicle assembly, is the most dynamic, since automobile production capacity is much higher than demand, automakers can retool existing factories to manufacture EVs. For example, work to retool (convert a plant from ICE vehicles to EVs) at Volkswagen’s Zwickau factory in Germany began in 2018 and the first EVs were produced in November 2019. Similarly, Tesla’s EV factory in Shanghai was completed in roughly one year after breaking ground in early 2019. Battery production lead times can be more varied. In China, CATL has been able to deliver a new cell manufacturing facility in under one year due to experience in their production, while four years elapsed between the announcement of Northvolt’s first factory in Sweden and the beginning of production. Anode and cathode plants have lead times that are typical for chemical plants, which vary by region. Umicore announced production plans for a plant in Poland in 2018, which is expected to begin commercial production in 2022, thus requiring four years. In China, cathode factories can be built in less than two years due to previous experience and the use of existing sites for expansion. By far the longest lead times are in the extraction of raw materials. After an extractable resource is identified through exploration, it can take from four to more than twenty years for a mine to begin commercial production. Four to sixteen years can be required for the necessary feasibility studies, and engineering and construction work. Long lead times are often required to secure financing and the necessary permits. Securing permits can take from one to ten years due to some countries requiring multiple permits or due to permitting delays. There is some evidence that over the decades, the time required to bring mines online has increased and this can be partially attributed to longer permitting and feasibility study lead times. In addition to the time required to begin commercial production, mines often require around ten years before they reach nameplate production capacity. An analysis of lead times across the supply chain indicates that with sufficient investment, downstream stages of the EV battery supply chain can ramp up to meet even rapid increases in demand in the 2030 time frame. However, upstream mineral extraction can cause major bottlenecks unless adequate investments are delivered well in advance.

Battery chemistries will be more diversified by 2030 as manufacturers select battery chemistries to serve specific vehicle characteristics. As exemplified by Volkswagen’s announcement, chemistries will be adapted to the vehicle category: premium vehicles can be expected to use the most high energy density batteries available, likely higher nickel content chemistries such as NCA95, NMCA and NMC9.5.5, or potentially those with even higher energy density, such as lithium nickel oxide (LNO) or lithium-manganese-rich NMC (LMR-NMC) if research challenges can be solved and commercially viable cycle life is achieved. For lower end, high volume and principally urban vehicles, LFP will be the primary chemistry as driving range is not the priority, and instead it is cost. Moreover, due to high commodity prices for nickel and cobalt and the expiry of key patents, LFP is set for major growth in volume models in Europe and the United States in the coming years. Announcements have been made by key automakers such as Tesla and Volkswagen for LFP use for standard range EVs in both markets. The possibility of battery packs containing both LFP and high-nickel recently became reality with NIO announcing their CTP pack including both LFP and NMC cells to utilise the benefits of both chemistries. For mid-range vehicles, the manganese-rich chemistry (lithium nickel manganese oxide [LNMO]) is a strong contender as it has a higher energy density than LFP, yet does not reach the levels of the highnickel chemistries. The larger proportion of manganese in LNMO reduces material costs and commodity exposure considerably compared to high-nickel chemistries. However, LNMO is still under development. Volkswagen has indicated its long-term strategy to pursue manganese-rich chemistries for mass-market EV models. For medium and heavy-duty vehicles, LFP will account for the vast majority of installations as cost and reliability will be more important for the early applications of electric trucks. LFP has the best cycle life of the leading chemistries which suits frequent, short trips and being recharged often. On the other hand, longer range electric trucks are likely to use nickel-based chemistries with the highest energy density, but their deployment in the period to 2030 is limited. Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 182 EV batteries and supply chains The future of battery chemistries is not set in stone. There are advantages and disadvantages of the various chemistries. A sustained period of high battery metal prices may therefore have a dramatic impact on battery chemistries, accelerating the shifts already underway and anticipated due to current high prices. Sustained high commodity prices would support a shift towards chemistries with lower critical mineral intensity. Two primary impacts can be expected. First, a stronger shift to commercial chemistries with lower critical material intensity, particularly LFP which contains no nickel or cobalt. Second, an acceleration in the development of new chemistries which rely on less critical minerals, such as the manganese-rich cathode chemistry LNMO and even alternative lithium-free battery chemistries similar to Li-ion such as sodium-ion (Na-ion). Sodium-ion batteries While researchers across the world are working to develop battery chemistries that do not use lithium, the closest most viable option today is Na-ion technology. Na-ion is currently being developed by one of the world’s largest battery makers, CATL, which commercially introduced Na-ion in 2021 and plans to form a basic industrial supply chain by 2023. Alongside the developments from CATL for Na-ion, the Chinese government plans to promote the development of the Na-ion battery industry in its 14th Five-Year Plan, with industry standards to achieve scale, lower cost and improve performance. Naion cells will have just over half the energy density of leading highnickel chemistries and therefore, will not be used for high energy density applications. However, it is comparable with LFP with only around 20% lower energy density than the leading LFP cells. Therefore, for applications where energy density is not critical, for example urban EVs or grid-scale storage, Na-ion is suitable. CATL is also mitigating the energy density limitations through their new AB battery pack design which can integrate both Li-ion and Na-ion cells in one pack. The critical advantage of Na-ion over Li-ion is that it relies on abundant and low cost minerals. The cathode material for the CATL Na-ion battery (Prussian White) is made of low cost elements sodium, iron, nitrogen and carbon. Na-ion cannot use graphite anodes, so instead uses hard carbon. In addition, less copper is required as Naion can use aluminium anode current collectors, unlike Li-ion. While Na-ion has advanced beyond the research stage with demonstration of"}

While Na-ion has advanced beyond the research stage with demonstration of commercially viable performance, there are no supply chains today for its cathode and anode materials. The main uncertainties around the deployment of Na-ion is the scalability of the production processes for these materials and the time required to develop an industrial scale supply chain. Fortunately, due to the similarity of Naion and Li-ion, it is relatively simple to adapt current cell factories to the production of Na-ion cells. Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 183 EV batteries and supply chains Constrained Chemistry Case To illustrate the impact of the possible trends, we present the Constrained Chemistry Case. It focusses on cathode chemistries to assess the impact of prices remaining high for longer, coupled with a strong reaction from automakers to high prices. The most significant change is major substitution from high-nickel cathode chemistries to LFP. In the Constrained Chemistry Case for the Stated Policies Scenario, global demand for nickel is reduced by 10% or about 440 kt per year, while the demand for cobalt is reduced by 15% equivalent to 35 kt per year. The reduction in nickel is substantial as it is almost twice the 2021 total production of nickel in Russia (the world’s largest Class 1 nickel producer). For the Announced Pledges Scenario, the demand reduction is even more significant with 15% total demand reduction for nickel and 20% for cobalt. Lithium demand would be slightly reduced in the Constrained Chemistry Case, with only a 3% reduction in both the Stated Policies and Announced Pledges Scenarios mainly due to LFP having a slightly lower lithium intensity per kWh than high-nickel chemistries so its much larger deployment also reduces lithium demand. LNMO also has lower lithium intensity so it supports lithium demand reduction. The introduction of Na-ion by 2030, being the only chemistry that does not contain lithium, notably decreases lithium demand with only a small share. Therefore, in the short term, lithium demand cannot be significantly reduced, though there is potential in the longer term.

When looking to 2030, the situation is more uncertain, but a continuation of trends should generally be sufficient to meet demand for all metals if all anticipated supply comes online, though with a small margin. Nonetheless, this still requires a significant effort: dozens of mining projects will have to enter the market and reach capacity on schedule and tens of new mineral processing and precursor plants will have to be commissioned. Also, in order to translate this into EV deployment, tens of cathode and anode plants, gigafactories and EV production plants are required. Demand for lithium will greatly exceed current supply projections by 2030 in the Announced Pledges Scenario. To meet climate and zero emissions targets, additional investments will have to flow into the mining industry. Lithium requires a 45% increase in demand in the Announced Pledges Scenario compared to the Stated Policies Scenario or a 33% increase from projected supply in 2030 – roughly 15 additional mines would be required on top of projected supply. For nickel, demand in the Announced Pledges Scenario is just over supply, however the total projected supply includes both Class 1 and 2 nickel whereas batteries require Class 1 or significant additional processing of Class 2 nickel. Therefore, significant investments are needed. In the Constrained Chemistry Case, the demand for all metals will decrease, in particular for nickel and cobalt. Nickel demand in the Announced Pledges Scenario would be reduced to be the same as in the Stated Policies Scenario in 2030. For cobalt, the Announced Pledges Scenario demand is met by projected supply, but the Constrained Chemistry Case would reduce the Announced Pledges Scenario demand to 22% below supply estimates, a considerable supply surplus. For lithium, this would reduce the gap between the Announced Pledges Scenario demand and projected supply by 13%. Though the price of cobalt is rising and the supply of cobalt is highly concentrated geographically and thus more vulnerable to supply shocks, it is expected that in the long term cobalt supply will likely not be as much of an issue as lithium and nickel. This is due to the trend of moving away from cobalt in cathode chemistries, coupled with the expansion of recycling as cobalt is the most valuable battery metal per kilogramme. In the long term, recycling will contribute significantly to supply. However, only small contributions from recycling are expected by 2030, particularly for lithium and nickel.

Demand in this scenario in 2030 is projected to increase by 30% per year for lithium, 11% for nickel and 9% for cobalt. By comparison, supply of lithium in the past five years has increased 6% per year, nickel by 5% and cobalt by 8%. Therefore, meeting the Net Zero Scenario demand for electrification requires large investments in the supply of battery minerals – just as in all other clean energy technology sectors. However, actions can be taken to minimise demand by addressing two key levers: mineral intensity of batteries and average battery size per vehicle. Average battery sizes increased by 60% between 2015 and 2021. This reflects both increased average driving range and increased average energy consumption, as a larger share of electric cars are SUVs. Vehicles with more than 110 kWh batteries are already being produced. In the coming years, if current trends continue, we expect battery sizes to continue to increase by up to 30% in 2030. In the Net Zero Scenario, this trend could be curbed by enacting policies that discourage vehicles with extremely large batteries, for example by linking incentives to battery sizes or, in the longer term, taxing EVs with large batteries. If by 2030 battery sizes remained equal to today, 16% of incremental battery metal demand could be avoided. Innovative battery chemistries in the Net Zero Scenario scenario are developed more rapidly, following an increase in investment for innovation. For example, all-solid-state batteries are expected to enter the market earlier than in the Stated Policies Scenario. If innovation focussed on minimising the material footprint in the Net Zero Scenario, by following the Constrained Chemistries cathode mix, demand for the key battery metals would decrease by up to onethird. In addition, the Net Zero Scenario investment in innovation may also bring forward novel extraction and processing technologies, such as DLE, clean HPAL and re-mining from mining waste, that can all contribute to increasing supply.

Instead, DLE technologies directly extract lithium from unconcentrated brine either through adsorption, ion exchange or solvent extraction techniques. DLE relies on high selectivity technologies which can extract lithium from complex and varied brines and reject impurities. As well as offering cost and lead time advantages, DLE has sustainability advantages and widens the pool of economically extractable lithium supply. For example, areas unsuitable for evaporation ponds such as lithium-rich geothermal brines, where there is significant resource, such as the Salton Sea in California. Environmental impacts can be considerably reduced compared to conventional hard rock mining and evaporative pond processes. Nevertheless, achieving robust selectivity and scaling up DLE technologies remains challenging. For example, many DLE technologies must be tuned to the conditions of the brine. DLE is an emerging process yet to be tested at scale, however, several companies are leading in the development of DLE projects such as POSCO, Standard Lithium and Vulcan Energy. There are mining companies looking to use DLE as well as companies developing DLE technology, with a number of joint ventures being formed. Novel nickel routes can increase the variety of supply sources Batteries require Class 1 nickel, typically from sulphide deposits. Most production growth in the near future, however, is coming from regions with significant laterite resources, which produce Class 2 nickel, such as Indonesia and the Philippines. There are novel technologies which can convert low grade laterite resources into Class 1 nickel. HPAL (high-pressure acid leaching) is a form of hydrometallurgy that uses acid separation under high temperature and pressure to produce nickel at Class 1 grade suitable for battery applications. Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 191 EV batteries and supply chains HPAL however, comes with significant challenges, predominantly due to cost and lead times. Capital costs for HPAL projects typically are double that of conventional smelters for oxide ore and take about four to five years to reach capacity. Recent projects have also suffered from major delays and cost overruns. Nevertheless, projects are coming online with China leading investment in HPAL projects, particularly in Indonesia. Indonesia’s first HPAL battery nickel project, a joint venture between Indonesian company Harita Group and Chinese company Ningbo Lygend Mining Co. started operating in 2021. There are also concerns with the environmental impact of HPAL as it often uses coal or oil-fired boilers for heat, thus emitting up to three times more GHG emissions than production from sulphide deposits. There are companies attempting to make HPAL more sustainable such as Clean Teq, a company developing a solar-powered HPAL project in Australia, where steam and heat are also recovered. Mixed hydroxide precipitate (MHP) is becoming increasingly important as an intermediate product produced from laterite, which can be refined into nickel and cobalt sulphates needed for batteries at low cost. MHP can also be processed into nickel and cobalt products from selective acid leaching, a process with a lower environmental footprint. MHP, often produced from HPAL, is becoming an important feedstock over nickel metal due to its lower cost and the expected increase in availability. Another method being explored is the conversion of nickel pig iron (low grade 3-12% nickel) into an intermediate grade nickel matte (>50% concentration), a precursor to nickel sulphate used for batteries. This would significantly increase the pool of potential nickel able to be used in batteries, however, it is a highly emissions-intensive process (four times more than HPAL) and much more than conventional sulphide production. Tsingshan, the major Chinese steel producer, is pursuing this process and made its first shipment in 2022. The economics are uncertain with another facility in New Caledonia having closed as it was too expensive. Tsingshan is looking to utilise clean energy for its operation to reduce the impact, however, the process uses a significant amount of direct fuels, raising into question its realisable potential for reducing emissions in line with other techniques. Re-mining from mining waste Recovery from mining waste, refered to as re-mining, is a novel process of extraction of valuable minerals and metals from mine tailings, waste water and rock. This is a potentially significant source of supply that so far has been unrealised. For example, tailings for nickel and copper mining were 4 billion tonnes in 2017. There are several start-ups focussing on this including the Rio Tinto backed start-up Regeneration.

Uptake of EVs will need to look at energy and network capacity A common concern related to EV charging is whether power systems can handle increased demand for electricty as electric vehicles are deployed in greater numbers. Power system operators must balance supply and demand on the grid at all times. To do so requires sufficient power resources through generation or storage and ample network capacity. Bulk energy: Sufficient power resources are required to serve the increase in load from EVs. In the large economies that today are leaders in EV deployment, e.g. China, Europe and the United States, EVs account for under 5% of total electricity consumption in the Announced Pledges Scenario in 2030. At such a level, smart charing of EVs could provide value to the power system. Network capacity: Adequately sized and equipped transmission and distribution networks are required. The relationship of EV uptake to upgrade needs is not necessarily straightforward. For example, a distribution system may have high levels of electricity demand but some lines may be sized for small capacity due to low loads and low predicted load growth, such as in rural areas compared to urban areas. Clustering effects especially in residential areas could pose problems even at low EV uptake. Network upgrades are generally expensive. Maximising the use of the network over a 24-hour period can be more cost-effective than upgrading assets to serve peak periods that occur for relatively short periods over a daily period. EV charging is but one of many additional sources of demand that are putting increasing demand pressure on power grids. For instance, switching to electric heat, adding an air conidtioner and other applicances, not to mention the expanding array of plug-in devices in homes, offices businesses and the like are contributing to higher level of electricity demand at different times of the day. Besides more demand, power system operators are balancing an increasing proportion of variable renewables (VRE) in the bulk power supply and at the distribution level which are driving changes in system operations and requiring network upgrades. In many cases, PVs factor more into network upgrades compared to EV charging or other newly electrified loads. Four cases are presented that reflect the situation of most markets in terms of EV penetration speed and VRE deployment. We consider challenges to the grid as well as opportunities in relation to these four illustrative cases. In the Global EV Outlook 2020, we explored the peak load impact of projected electromobility in 2030 and found it to be less than 10%, even if unmanaged. In this version of the Outlook, we explore the impact of EVs at distribution grid level.. Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 195 EV grid integration IEA. All rights reserved.

Though deploying fast charging could entail costly upgrades. Passive measures might be sufficient, especially if flexibility needs are minimal.

Note: V1G = charging is unidirectional where the grid supplies power to the vehicle.

All rights reserved. Existing grids in major EV markets should be able to handle the added demand by 2030… With most EV charging expected to occur at residences, their distribution grids will need to manage significant additional loads. As usual when new types of loads are added to distribution networks, some will require equipment upgrades such as low and medium voltage transformers and lines. After an initial location-specific EV load threshold for which no grid upgrades are needed is surpassed, the grid upgrade requirements in the EV roll out phase are roughly proportional to the number of EVs. Grid simulation results based on German distribution grid case studies show that until EVs reach around 20% of all vehicle stock, upgrade requirements are rather sparse and mostly focussed on transformers that require upgrades to deal with voltage control (similar conclusions were found in an Australian study). This is a switch from passive to active transformers that can control voltage levels on the low voltage side, so-called intelligent or on-load tapchanging transformers. Rural areas, with relatively weaker grids might be the first to require upgrades. The simulation indicated that beyond 20% EV stock share, the required grid adaptation becomes significant. With up to a quarter of all transformers requiring upgrades in rural areas and 10% in urban areas. Line upgrades, which are the most complex and expensive operations, are likely to remain limited to less than 2% of the total line asset even with 40% EV stock share, based on the case study simulation. The results of this simulation are representative of most countries that fall in Cases 2 and 3. There are three reasons why grid upgrade needs are relatively low for moderate EV penetration levels. First, while the load of an individual EV is high compared to typical houshold loads, when several EVs are in a system,"}

First, while the load of an individual EV is high compared to typical houshold loads, when several EVs are in a system, not all their loads are coincident. When a sufficient number of users are considered, the effective maximum load is only a fraction of the maximum possible load. Second, by 2030 current distribution grids will have to continue to expand to serve additional loads coming from the installation of small-scale solar photovoltaics and the electrification of heat, among other increased electricity demands. Third, in most industrialised countries, distribution grids historically have been over designed and many retain significant spare capacity. In both the Announced Pledges Scenario and the Stated Policies Scenario most regions have EV stock shares ranging between 1020% by 2030, and roughly a third of all EVs will be in regions with a stock share below 10%. Existing grids should be able to handle the added power demand from EVs in Europe, China and North America in most circumstances.

All rights reserved. …yet, grid upgrades will be needed for heavy-duty EVs, frontrunner cities and in developing and emerging markets While country level stock shares will remain below critical thresholds in the next decade, certain cities or provinces might reach higher local stock shares and thus experience stronger grid impacts which require upgrades before 2030. In some cases, cities that are early EV adopters are also ahead in terms of space heating electrification or distributed VRE. These additional loads can result in grid congestion already. As the energy transition proceeds, more issues of grid congestion might occur in frontrunner cities, well before 2030. The addition of charging stations for heavy-duty vehicles can add stress to a grid given their high power ratings. Flexibility in the location of the charging point, that is, locating the charging station where connection capacities are available, can help. However, existing bus depots (where tens of buses need to charge) often do not have this flexibility and thus might require distribution grid upgrades for the electrification of the fleet. The situation is different in emerging market and developing economies where existing networks are sized to smaller loads and therefore are weaker. Such countries are expected to account for 10% of the global EV stock by 2030 in the Stated Policies Scenario and 13% in the Announced Pledges Scenario. Their adoption of electric cars is slower compared to their markets; therefore, most developing and emerging countries fall under Case 1. Several studies, e.g. Brazil, Thailand and India, have been conducted on the impact of electromobility on transmission system level peak load. These studies show that in terms of bulk energy, the impact of EVs expected by 2030 is within the existing generation margins. At the distribution level, the grids in these countries are faced with continuously increasing loads (mostly from appliances), thus grid upgrades are required irrespective of EV loads. However, studies looking at the specific distribution grid impact of EVs remain scarce. The IEA will publish a manual for policymakers in developing and emerging markets on EV grid integration as part of the Global Environment Facility E-mobility programme. After 2030, EV stock shares are set to rapidly increase in all major markets in association with increased electrification of other energy services. Grid operators must ensure that that the necessary investments are made to accommodate these increasing loads beyond 2030: significant upgrades are likely to be required. Effective demand-response measures related to EV charging will be necessary to avoid extreme peak load events and disproportionate investment in grid upgrades.

Highway charging for electric cars and trucks requires significant investment in grid upgrades Satisfying demand for EV charging for all types of trips and for all vehicles modes will require the development of extensive charging networks along main transport corridors. Existing grids are expected to be able to accommodate most of the EVs that are projected to come into use in both urban and rural areas in the period to 2030. Highway charging, however, presents some specific difficulties. When transport corridors are located in areas with existing grids, the installation of chargers does not have major barriers, provided that the grid is not already congested. But to provide charging in more remote locations, grid upgrade costs can become a barrier. A typical roadside charging hub with several chargers suitable for LDVs is unlikely to demand more than a 2 megawatt (MW) connection, and thus is suitable to be connected to a low voltage network. In this instance, investment costs are proportional to the required length of line. The situation differs for HDV charging with up to 4.5 MW chargers are being considered by industry actors, over ten times more than the fastest chargers currently installed for LDVs. Such powerful chargers require connection to a medium voltage grid. Charging hubs able to serve several trucks at the same time (as would be required along major transport corridors) require connection capacity of more than 10 MW to a high voltage grid, which leads to notably higher cost. For electric truck charging hubs in more remote locations, the costs can skyrocket to USD 8 million per hub. Costs vary across regions. They are lower in China, less than a third for chargers and half of the grid connection cost compared with Europe. Technological progress can help alleviate some of these challenges. Technology development and learning-by-doing for fast chargers for LDVs has brought cost declines, and this is likely to be the case for electric truck chargers. In addition, innovative modular and containerised solutions for substations and transformers are likely to help lower costs for these components. However, power line costs are unlikely to decrease significantly as they are very mature technologies. Alternative solutions such as installing batteries or including distributed renewable capacity at charging stations can help alleviate the grid infrastructure costs required to connect these stations to the grid.

Faster approval times for grid upgrades are essential to ensure adequate charging networks by Creating and upgrading grid connections is a complex task involving a multitude of planning, approval and procurement steps, each of which requires significant lead times. Permitting processes including impact studies, involvement of multiple stakeholders, discussions of alternative routes can double the estimated time to bring a connection project online. In case of higher voltage connections, total project time can exceed four years. The permitting time varies considerably across regions and jurisdictions. Engineering, procurement and construction of substations and chargers can follow predictable timetables. The most time critical element is transformer procurement, as transformers tend to have long manufacturing lead times. The construction of new lines can also require significant time, especially for higher voltage connections. The lack of an extensive charging infrastructure network can slow EV adoption. It is of paramount importance that the required grid upgrades are put in place as swiftly as possible while taking into account the legitimate claims of all stakeholders. Clear approval timelines and enhancing the administrative processing capacity of entities tasked with approval processes will help to accelerate EV deployment. Given the long lead times, co-ordinating power system planning to adequately reflect the multitude of increasing demand sources and their load profiles is a must to avoid bottlenecks.

Adoption of digital technologies and smart charging can alleviate the need for grid upgrades Uncoordinated EV charging risks compounding concerns for grid operators to balance supply and demand, as well as placing additional pressure on networks. This could necessitate additional investment in peaking resources. The impacts can be difficult to manage, especially at very high EV stock penetrations and in systems with a weak grid. Co-ordinated smart charging of EVs offers the potential to help smooth increases in peak demand. Time-of-use tariffs can facilitate demand-side response by giving consumers price signals to shift EV charging to off-peak periods. An effective approach to minimise the need for grid investment due to EV loads will be to make network constraints known at a granular level, identifying areas that are under the most stress, including at the distribution system level. This allows smart charing to be tailored accordingly. Deployment of smart charging for EVs faces a number of challenges:  Lack of distribution grid transparency: Network operators in medium and low voltage systems may not be able to forecast or have adequate data on real-time loads at a geographically granular level. Aggregation and analysis of data from smart meters and the installation of distributed grid sensing equipment can help to overcome this barrier.  Lack of demand-response technologies on a large-scale at the load level: Technologies to send and receive detailed signals for individual loads exist. However, their current application is limited to a few pilot projects and businesses. This reflects lack of a strong business case currently for these technologies.  Inadequate market framework: The market design and regulatory framework in most countries does not provide a mechanism for contracting flexibility services between distribution system operators (DSOs) and consumers. Co-ordination between transmission system operators and DSOs needs to be strengthened to ensure coherence between the call for flexibility for local congestion and for system balancing. Smart grids that monitor load and control smart charging are being demonstrated in a number of countries, e.g. United States and Portugal. By the end of this decade, at least partial application of smart grid technologies is projected to help curb the need for investment in grid upgrades due to EV charging by ensuring that peak load events are subdued or avoided.In the longer term, as EVs account for more than one-third of the stock, smart grids will be necessary to avoid very high investment requirements. Eventually, the development and deployment of vehicle to grid technologies will enable vehicles to be plugged into smart chargers to contribute to balancing the system. In this manner, EVs will contribute to grid stability rather than being a source of instability to network balancing needs. Countries that fall in Case 3 A are more likely to require this technology.

Smart charging for EVs offers new opportunities for power systems Higher shares of variable renewables in in the generation mix are contributing to the transition needed to meet decarbonisation targets. Demand for electricity is increasing to power EVs, rising numbers of connected devices, improved energy access and a multitude of services. With rising demand comes the importance of power system flexibility, smart infrastructure and digital connectivity. New sources of flexibility can help to ensure that power systems are in balance at all times. The IEA projects that for the energy sector to reach net zero by 2050 globally, flexibility in electric networks needs to quadruple in that period. EVs and their batteries could provide a huge reservoir of flexibility to facilitate the energy transition. There are three main types of smart charging: • Off-peak charging: Uses simple signals, such as a time-of-use tariff to incentivise users to charge during off-peak hours or when there is a surplus of generation from renewables. • Unidirectional managed charging: Charging time, rate and duration are controlled and optimised by adapting to price signals and power system needs. It requires signals on grid and renewable supply availability to be sent by a power system operator or an aggregator. • Bidirectional managed or vehicle-to-grid (V2G): Charging for EVs that are technically able to input electricity into the grid.

In this practice, EVs serve as distributed energy storage, dynamically charging at times when system availability is the highest and providing additional power supply when called upon. For all types of charging, optimisation criteria are fundamental. Consumers can take advantage of flexibility options to manage their own consumption; match it with the output of their rooftop solar panel, and reduce the electricity bill if time-of-use tariffs are available. They may also be able to sell flexibility services to the wholesale and balancing markets of the power system. This can help to manage balance and peaking on the system. For example, it can offer local flexibility services to the DSO to smooth grid constraints through voltage support or congestion management. Of course, this is in addition to serving the charging needs of the consumer’s EV. Markets and regulations must reward flexibility Ensuring that markets and regulations reflect the value of flexibility options for the system is a first step to boost smart EV charging adoption. Consumer provided flexibility services will incur costs, for instance, in terms of battery degradation that must be appropriately valued. This value can be reflected at every level of the power market. Cost-reflective time-sensitive consumer tariffs will incentivise drivers to charge their EV when it does not stress the network or when output Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 PAGE | 205 EV grid integration IEA.

All rights reserved. Open markets that include wholesale markets and those for flexibility services such as balancing, congestion management and voltage control can provide tailored incentives by rewarding flexibility options where and when they have the most value. The higher the granularity of such price signals in time and space, the more value they bring to the system, but also the more complex they get. Consumers alone cannot be expected to deal with highly detailed signals or to navigate several layers of energy markets. This role is can be undertaken by aggregators (either independent or utility subsidaries) that contract with individual customers to provide flexibility services and manage a pool of flexibility providers to maximise revenues and benefits to the participants and the system. Policy makers willing to harness smart charging flexibility potential can take measures to ensure their markets are adapted to distributed energy resources. One is to ensure that aggregators, and generally speaking every type of distributed flexibility provider (e.g. energy communities, peer-to-peer trading), have access to markets on a level playing field basis with traditional flexibility providers, such as power plants or large industries. The most appropriate way to incorporate EV charging flexibility will vary depending on the power system and market specificities. But fundamentals such as the right to participate, product specifications, rules for control and flexibility measurement should be assessed to ensure that undue burden is not placed on the distributed flexibility providers. Regulations should leave room for businesses to develop innovative pricing solutions and business models that best fit both consumers and power system needs. Electric vehicle supply equipment deployment and charging management A major pre-condition for smart charging business development is the availability to control the charging of a large number of EVs. Interoperability allows aggregators to pool vehicles more easily and without burdensome procedures and interventions at consumer residences. This is key to smart charging development.

Seasonal tariffs are not included in this table as they are not considered to be enabling since EV charging patterns are based on daily variations. In Greece, the e-mobility law specifies that all public access charging points must be smart chargers and private charge points must be smart charge capable to qualify for a subsidy. In Italy, the Ministerial Vehicle-to-Grid Decree authorises EVs in the ancillary services market and covers the cost to convert existing connections to smart chargers. In New Zealand, several electricity retailers offer plans with lower off-peak rates or rates that track wholesale spot prices, and some plans specifically target EV owners. There are no established standards or policies for smart charging in New Zealand, though voluntary guidelines introduced in 2021 include specifications for smart charging.

Phased approach to building a smart charging strategy in the United Kingdom As part of its goal to ban new ICE cars by 2030, effectively shifting to EVs and PHEVs, the United Kingdom took action to mandate smart EV chargers. The Automated and Electric Vehicles (AEV) Act 2018, mandates that all EV charge points sold and installed in the country have smart functionality and meet minimum device level requirements. The United Kingdom was an early adopter of a policy to mandate smart charger functionality; others such as France have followed suit. Germany and Greece mandate smart charging for private chargers to qualify for subsidies. Greece mandates smart chargers for all publicly accessible charging points. Portugal mandates smart chargers at publicly accessible charging points. In July 2021, the UK government released its smart charging strategy that is based on a two-phased approach. This enables policy makers to set out the framework in phase 1 while providing visibility to stakeholders on the policy direction, yet having an opportunity to develop and adjust for more complex topics that will be adressed in phase 2. Phase 1 requires that new charge points, public or private, be smart chargers and be set by default to charge only at off-peak times of the electricity system. Smart functionality is defined at the device level and includes: the ability to send and receive information; to modify the time of charging in response to information received; and to use the functions to provide demand-response services. It also incorporates basic cybersecurity standards (existing cybersecurity standard ETSI EN 303 645), basic interoperability to ensure that charge points are not designed to block change of supplier, and data accessibility, including customer access to consumption data. The specifications are outined in regulations for EV smart charge points that come into force in June 2022. Phase 2 topics include full charge point operator interoperability (the ability of consumers to switch operators) and more in-depth analysis of elements such as cybersecurity and grid stability.

Historical data and projections Following extensive data work conducted for the IEA report, An Energy Sector Roadmap to Carbon Neutrality in China, we have reassessed stocks and sales of electric two-wheelers in China, excluding electric bicycles, which were unintentionally included in previous editions of the Global EV Outlook. Stocks and sales of electric two-wheelers in China now account for electric scooters and motorbikes only, which leads to a considerable downward revision both in electricity demand and oil displacement provided by electric two-wheelers in China. Additional revisions to the electric twowheeler sales and stocks in other East and Southeast Asian 28 The results presented for the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario are based on modelling done for the IEA’s Net Zero by 2050: A Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector published in 2021. countries (including India, Indonesia, and other Association of Southeast Asian Nation [ASEAN] countries) have been made on the basis of more detailed data. Further revisions to the data in China include the energy intensity estimates of electric buses based on updates on the split of electric bus sales by size, and on the split between light commercial vehicles and medium- and heavy-freight truck sales. These revisions are based on data compiled from the China Automotive Industry Yearbook and other industry articles. In addition, due to differences in regional aggregation in the GECModel, the definition of Europe in this edition is broader than in previous ones. Previously, Europe included the member states of the European Union plus Iceland, Norway and the United Kingdom. This year, it also includes eastern European countries (excluding Russia), Turkey, Switzerland and Israel.

Annexes to ensure that they match country level and regional panel data, these parameters are projected to evolve depending on changes in GDP. This update enables a more detailed and nuanced exploration of how different vintages of two-wheelers and cars, but especially of commercial vehicles (light commercial vehicles, buses and trucks) are used. It reflects the reality that newer vehicles are driven more, and hence make up a larger share of fuel consumption. This implies that electrification and other efficiency technologies have a faster potential to displace oil and to contribute to decarbonisation than would otherwise be projected. Mileage assumptions for EVs also have been recalibrated.. The mileage of plug-in and battery electric vehicles has been assumed to be similar to the gasoline or diesel counterparts for light commercial vehicles, buses and trucks through 2030. In regions where low mileage estimates are used to calibrate to match historical trajectories of gasoline and/or diesel consumption as reported by country energy, statistics and/or transport ministries, these mileages are projected to converge to the global average mileage of that vehicle category. Electric vehicle supply equipment For projections of the deployment of electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) required to support EV adoption, the modelling uses historical EVSE-to-EV stock ratios by region to inform future ratios. The current and projected share of EVs with access to residential chargers is informed by current population distributions by dwelling type and provision of home charging. Benchmarking for historical estimates and projections of electricity demand by charger type are based on these data on dwelling type, plus surveys of historical and current charging patterns. Projections for public lightduty vehicle chargers are based on public charging capacity per EV, where the public capacity required per PHEV is assumed to be less than per BEV (since PHEVs have the option to fuel with petrol as opposed to full dependency on electric charging).
